> Storytelling and listening are reciprocal; water takes the shape of its glass.

A few years ago, I attended a day-long storytelling workshop.  I left the workshop delighted, and exhausted.  

The workshop's ingredients:   
-two excellent instructors, Jerome Deroy and Terence Mickey  
-twelve students, ages 27 to 75  
-six hours  
-one tape recorder, ten tapes, pencils, and paper  
-listening, feeling, writing, sharing, and – of course – storytelling  
-vulnerability  

The day began with a discussion of the importance of listening and followed with a handful of listening exercises. This set the tone for the remainder of the workshop and made it easy to refrain from taking notes. 

While my inner stenographer documented its displeasure, the rest of me later enjoyed recalling the most important points from the session, as follows. 

## High resolution listening   
> I strain to hear the speaker clearly over the noise in the hallway. Might we close the door?  

As a speaker tells their story, take inventory of both internal distractions (e.g. I'm hungry) and external distractions (e.g. the guy next to me is typing on a mechanical keyboard using his elbows). A distraction is anything that comes to mind – thoughts, judgments – or body – discomfort, cravings – requiring your attention and thus distracting disrupting listening.

_Am I thinking about the bills I will have to pay?_  
_I'm cold. Is it just me?_  
_Does my head itch?_   
_Am I missing a loved one?_  

For internal distractions, acknowledge and, then, dismiss them.  

For external distractions, particularly those under your immediate control, take action to remove them. Out them.  

If the room is too cold, then it is distracting your listening. If you feel this way, it's likely that others do, too. 

Rather than second-guessing your internal temperature, observing what others are wearing and scanning the room for body language that signals others are cold for validation, say something.   

## A story well told  
> How do you engineer a story so that your listener feels what your character felt without telling the listener what your character felt?  

Listen to people tell their stories. Take note of the moments when a speaker lures you in, when you begin to feel something.  

_What happened? Was it the content? Did you see it with your eyes or hear it with your ears?_

Here are a few patterns that engaged me as a listener.  

**Pausing**  
Don't rush. 

Wait. Breathe. Begin again. Stop. Continue.  

**Honesty**  
Tell the story as it were, not as you prefer it to be.  

Share an unpopular reaction or an example of your unrefined behavior.  

**Share flaws, bruises, and bumps**  
I believe imperfection builds trust, resembles reality, and helps me to silence my own obstacles that may arise as I begin comparing your story to my own when enough similarities arise.  

Professionally and personally, I try hard to steer clear of people who are averse to the phrase, 'I don't know.'

**Vulnerability**  
A speaker who is vulnerable as they tell their story, not just in the tale, has my heart and ear.  

**Tone and volume**  
Events, descriptions, and time convey the content of the speaker's story while tone and volume help reveal the emotion of the speaker (and may wake a dozing listener).  

**Specificity**  
The small sounds, smells, and nicknames you use in your story will become the anchors a listener recalls. 

**Precarious context**  
Juxtapositions, uncertainty, risk, promises, losses, and poor odds attract the listener's attention and build their anticipation.  

# When telling a story  
> Remember, as you use a word in your story, the listener is imagining it. 

**Write your story as if it were told through a camera lens (and microphone)**  
Cameras cannot speak on behalf of a character's inner feelings, thoughts, needs, or wants. Video describes only what is seen or heard. 

From behind the viewfinder, you can see that he was shivering in the rain, that he held the sweater she left behind to his nose before falling asleep, and that his colleague's smile began with him pulling his bottom lip down and apart from his top.  

**Communicate feeling through events, not internal dialogue**  
Stick to What, How, Where, When, and Who. Then, What Happened Next. And repeat. 

This is harder than you might think. 

For exercise, try telling a story without using the words, 'I thought' or 'I felt.' Tell your story with actions, events, and observable behavior.  

**Use a story arc and your space**   
A story consists of a few major events that form an arc: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and denouement. To help you to remember the flow of your story and utilize the physical space available to you, pair each point in your story with a unique location in the room. As you arrive at a new point in your story, begin walking toward its location in the room.  This is handy for people who forget they are capable of lifting their feet as soon as they stand at the front of an audience and begin speaking.
