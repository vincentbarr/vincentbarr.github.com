I"å<p>Just stumbled upon <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/acquaintable">Acquaintable</a>, an app that helps you meet friends of friends without any human introductions. The app relies on the Facebook API to make recommendations based on your location (and maybe a handful of other things I couldnâ€™t extract from first use).</p>

<p>Datable might be a more suitable name, but Iâ€™ll digress right here.
What impressed me is their user approach to user acquisition. Referrals were a huge win for DropBox who couldnâ€™t exactly advertise on keywords because, believe it or not, there was a time when googling free cloud storage wasnâ€™t all that common. Accruing users rapidly at low cost is pretty important for a social site whose value proposition is making introductions; if ever there was a need for critical mass, this is it.</p>

<p>Check out the Acquaintable approach to referrals:</p>

<p>If I want 10 more snapshots, then I need to start inviting people. The invites are delivered as direct, personal Facebook messages as opposed to the dreaded event or app invite (and thus notification) that weâ€™ve all become accustomed to ignoring. I think this strategy will yield an above average user-to-referrer rate, as well as an above average recipient-to-lead rate. A direct, personal message feels more authentic to me â€“ not quite as a personal as a word-of-mouth recommendation, but still better than an email referral.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s unique about Acquaintableâ€™s referral program is that the reward for referring is provided regardless of fulfillment. In other words, you receive additional credits just for the act of referring others; redemption doesnâ€™t increase or decrease your reward. Whether this is intentional or just a temporary limitation to be corrected in their next release, I donâ€™t know.</p>
