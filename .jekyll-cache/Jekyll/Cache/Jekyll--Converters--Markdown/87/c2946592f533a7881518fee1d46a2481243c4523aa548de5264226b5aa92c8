I"J<p>Back when Facebook wasn’t a household name, Sean Parker &amp; Mark Zuckerberg sought out <a href="http://davidchoe.com/">artist David Choe</a> to pretty the ol’ office up with spraypaint.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.vincentbarr.com/assets/images/david-choe.png" alt="David Choe" /></p>

<p>Choe opted for equity over pay at the time, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I like to party, I like to gamble.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“How did you feel when you heard the news that you might be an estimated 200 million dollars?”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s how did I feel about the rest of the world knowing that, which I hated, you know. I was at home, and I was in bed and I got a text message. It was a woman I hadn’t spoken to in five years and she offered me oral sex every day for the rest of my life for 2 million dollars, just out of the blue.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thing is, David, that most people would be thrilled by 200 million dollars. For you, it’s causing you pain.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I cannot buy my privacy back.”</p>
</blockquote>
