{% include JB/setup %}

Venture capitalist, hedge fund manager, and intellectual Peter Thiel compares the future of technology with what we have currently, and what is required for the US to produce new jobs in his [interview with George Packer](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/11/28/111128fa_fact_packer).  

Equally interesting are the revelations about his personal life gleaned through Packer’s probing and careful observation. Thiel is a man who is aware and concerned with the problem of the human lifespan as it is: its finiteness. Only so much can be accomplished, experienced, and explored in a 100-year life.  

Peter Thiel is in my “Top 3 people I would like to have a coffee with… at 3am” list, right alongside Sean Parker.
