This past summer (August 2013), I planned to find a new apartment. I thought it would be nice to find a roommmate and get a better rental value. Not one of my friends was moving for at least another 3 months, so I took to Craigslist.  

The process of meeting roommates was an interesting one, and I'm not sure I care to relive it in writing, so instead I'll leave you with three interesting listings that tickled me to take screenshots.
