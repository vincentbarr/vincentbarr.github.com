"How did you choose the Lower East Side?"

I've been asked this question by more than five different people. At least one of those people asked out of sincerity and, I suspect, at least one preferred this question to a rhetorical one about the weather.

"Funny you should ask," I reply. 

"I decided to move here about two years ago, for three reasons.  

First, when walking through the neighborhood, I discovered an opening reception for a few legendary NYC writers (graffiti artists) to the tune of a live DJ, a diverse crowd and a bit of grit. And I tend to like grit.

Second, Sunshine Cinema is within two blocks of my apartment. Sunshine Cinema shows only seven movies at a time. On Sundays, they show one retro movie (Blade Runner was showing the weekend I moved in) and throughout the rest of the week a handful of specialized, independent films, some foreign. It's also very cozy (think ascending a flight of creaky wooden steps).

Third, the trailers and storage units that slumber among many of New York's neighborhoods receive special attention in the Lower East Side; they are the canvas to the [Centre-fuge Public Art Project](https://www.facebook.com/centrefugepublicartproject/timeline). Once every two months, artists from around-the-world visit to paint these bins. Walking back to my apartment on a Saturday afternoon, I have seen artists whom I admired in my early teens, such as The London Police, and others – Andy Golub, Dasic, the list goes on – painting live."

These were the three main reasons I was attracted to and chose to move to the Lower East Side.

Interestingly enough, the gallery of live music and aerosol was shut down the same week that I moved into my new apartment.

As for Sunshine Cinema, it required a full year-and-a-half and a Tindr date before I would actually make my first visit. But, it was a memorable one. Blow-Up (1966) was the the show of the hour and, if you haven't seen it or any of [Michelangelo Antonioni's work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo_Antonioni), then I'll leave you with an accurate description of what he is best known for: a "trilogy on modernity and its discontents" along with "his resistance to traditional storytelling in favor of enigmatic and intricate mood pieces, [rejecting] action in favor of contemplation."
