I"£<p>When is the last time you made any substantial contribution using just one skill?</p>

<p>Never. Thatâ€™s when.</p>

<p>If you play baseball, you must be able to throw and catch. If you are a good live comedian, you must write funny material and convey it.</p>

<p>And then thereâ€™s the less obvious â€œskills,â€ such as being able to stand in a field â€“ possibly for a few hours at a time â€“ and wait for a piece of yarned-cork to sail your way in foot suspenders, more commonly known as â€œstirrups,â€ that actually hook under the arch of your foot and pull up to the knee (for good reason, Iâ€™m sure).</p>

<p>High five, generalist.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2012/06/all-hail-the-generalist">Vikram Mansharamani explores</a> the decline of the once acclaimed specialist, which is great news for those of us who donâ€™t â€˜getâ€™ specializing in one thing when you can specialize in perhaps two or three things at negligible cost (this various, of course, by field, the person, the project, etc.) and need a little reassurance now and then.</p>

<p>One reason why generalists will affect positive disruption:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Specialists toil within a singular tradition and apply formulaic solutions to situations that are rarely well-defined. This often &gt; results in intellectual acrobatics to justify oneâ€™s perspective in the face of conflicting data. Think about Alan Greenspanâ€™s public admission of  â€finding a flawâ€ in his worldview. Academics and serious economists were dogmatically dedicated to the efficient market hypothesis â€” contributing to the inflation of an unprecedented credit bubble between 2001 and 2007.</p>
