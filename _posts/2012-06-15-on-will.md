I can’t help be but held captive and mesmerized by life experiences that depict the extreme triumph of will and examples of “life hacking” – that is getting from Point A to Point B in an unconventional, yet effective, manner.

[Dawn Loggins’s journey to Harvard University](http://www.universityherald.com/articles/2127/20120607/dawn-loggins-pursuit-happiness-homeless-student-earns.htm) is a good example, as is [Gac Filipaj‘s](http://vincentbarr.com/essais/gac-filipaj-education/), and many other heroes whose stories will go unsung.
The Tailored Scholar Blog describes Dawn’s senior year:  

> ”She also worked as a janitor, studied advanced-placement classes by candlelight in a hovel with no running water, and fiercely overcame the fact she was abandoned and left homeless by drug-addicted parents.”

That’s some ferocity alright. Enormous congratulations to Dawn.

Hopefully, her story can serve as a tale of hope to motivate the many adolescents in similar, or worse, situations.
