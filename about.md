#About Vincent Barr
![Calvin & Hobbes](/images/calvin-hobbes-dino.png)

##n.

a) Tinkerer, autodidact, reverse engineer-er-er with an appetite for interdisciplinarity and pistachios.  

b) Doesn’t buy into the whole division between “left-brain” and “right-brain” thinkers; idea-generators and idea-executors; and people from upstate New York and rhythm.  

c) Grew up reading hurricane-proof paperweights disguised as software manuals. Learned to build computers and small networks, dual-boot Windows and Linux (for no real reason), make basic apps, and gain an appreciation for anyone working in 3D Studio Max early in life.  

d) Stockpiles midnight oil. Reads McSweeney’s for LOLz. Urbant art enthusiast and muralist on hiatus.  

##Work

Thrilled to wear many hats and work with a smart, focused team as the Online Marketing Manager (and part junior product manager) for 10gen, the company behind MongoDB.  

##Causes  

Honored to serve as Co-Chair of the Mentor Leadership Council and Mentor-Coach at New York Needs You, a non-profit organization with the mission of helping first-generation college students recognize and pursue their professional aspirations, thus closing the opportunity gap. (This is the most moving non-profit organization I have experienced to date. Hands down).
