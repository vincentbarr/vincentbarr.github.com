#Quotes

I have a like-dislike relationship with quotes.  

I'm refreshed when I find someone who took what was once a nebulous, lingering thought or feeling for me and converted it into a figure with edges, color, features, and a name. Now, that feeling is a person distinct from the millions of others like him. 

And some quotes are just so damn clever.  

Some that I enjoy in some way:    

In response to NY Mag's question, 'How’d you get into the sunglass business?':   
**"We grew up in the suburbs, and people used to stare at us because we were different. We created eyewear to block eye contact. We like to be aliens, on our own planet.”**  
-Coco and Breezy Dotson, sunglass designers  

**"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable man adapts the world to himself. All progress depends on the unreasonable man."**  

-George Bernard Shaw, playwright and co-founder of London School of Economics  

**"Whenever you say 'I want to be' means first (by definition), 'I am not.' I don't want to be a not."**  

-James Altucher, Entrepeneur and honest  


**"We all have times when we think more effectively, and times when we should not be thinking at all."**  

-Daniel Cohen, Children's Writer  

**"Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast."**  

-Brian Birdwell, Manhattan GMAT Instructor
