##n.
a) Tinkerer, autodidact, reverse engineer-er-er with an appetite for interdisciplinarity (and pistachios, red ones).

b) Doesn’t buy into the whole division between “left-brain” and “right-brain” thinkers; idea-generators and idea-executors; and people from upstate New York and rhythm.

c) Early in life, grew up reading hurricane-proof paperweights disguised as software manuals; building computers and small networks, dual-booting Windows and Linux (for no real reason), making basic (visual basic, basic) apps, and gaining an appreciation for anyone working in 3D Studio Max or Rhino 3D (props).

d) Stockpiles midnight oil. Reads McSweeney’s for LOLz. Urbant art enthusiast and muralist on hiatus.
