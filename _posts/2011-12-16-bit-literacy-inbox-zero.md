Experience design entrepreneur Mark Hurst's wrote [_Bit Literacy_](http://amzn.to/16UZNjn) urged me to ‘achieve emptiness,’ or reduce my email inbox count to 0.  

And I did.  

It was a first – and as the book suggests – it’s a powerful feeling, albeit a funny one. I would compare it to the feeling you get acquainting yourself with an unfamiliar, open wall after finally dismounting the painting from your living room that had been a 5-year long eyesore.  

_That wall is awfully... white?  Should I paint it?_  

His system to manage the “bits” is simple and effective, as it should be.
