In no particular order, a handful of things that I learned this week:

1.  **“[Premeditating evils](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324705104578147333270637790.html),” or visualizing the worst case scenario of an experiment in detail, is a good thing.** Odds are that the cost of failure is much less than originally conceived. I think this is because prior to premeditation, it was really the element of the unknown that was so terrifying.

2.  **If New York’s Financial District were a website, it would win an award for New York’s worst navigation and information architecture.** Try finding a place on Pearl Street, I dare you.

3.  **There are two morning activities that put me in the mood for holiday season love without fail:** listening to Adina Howard and that seasonal cinnamon aroma in Starbucks.

4.  **Neil Patel’s Quick Sprout blog is [one of the best online marketing resources](http://www.quicksprout.com/).** I read almost every article, in full, that he publishes. [ConversionXL](http://www.conversionxl.com) is also good for conversion rate optimization, a/b testing, and the like.

5.  **[Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php) + [Exobrain](https://www.exobrain.co) + 90M + me =** improved information naming, sorting, storage, and syncing across all of my devices.
