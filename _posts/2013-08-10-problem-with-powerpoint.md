Good PPT presentations use a font no smaller than 1,000px. Great PPT presentations use 1:10 text to image ratio. Legendary PPT presentations present no more than one idea per slide.

This presentation etiquette is something like adding for inches to your sleeves, dimming the lights, and hitting the smoke machine (and a way that makes it smoke more, not less). [\[1\]](#fn1)

Okay.

Now, let's look at this in practice vis a vis SlideShare's "Top Presentations of the Day" featured front and center on its homepage.

Now, Blaine, be a good boy and tell us what you did with Tufte.

As a slide is whiddled down to several words and a chart to a one-direction arrow, we, the audience, come to depend more on the speaker, to relay information. Our sensisitivity to body language, tone, and - to a lesser extent - words is heightened. The speaker comes to lean on humor and nonverbal cues and away from insights, evidence, and context .[\[2\]](#fn2)

Nonverbal behavior is deceiving. It's sleight of hand, and even with good intention it often has an adverse effect. When you add images and remove text, you're only adding only cups to the trick.

Expressive presentation masks quality.

Let's say you deliver two presentations. One is an informative, life-changing finding on X complete with supporting evidence and the debunking of commonly accepted hypotheses. The second is a phony, nonsensical presentation. You deliver both with high energy, humor, and warmth. Now, we, the audience, have no idea which was better. Now, we the audience actually have no idea which was better. We can't tell. We don't know better.

This phenomenon is explained by the [Dr. Fox Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Fox_effect). Warm, high energy speakers make it near impossible for attendees to discern the quality (or content coverage) of two very different speeches: one high in content coverage, and one not. When both lectures are delivered in an unexpressive manner, however, the audience can suddenly discern quality, or content coverage.

In a second experiment, pools of professionals sat through a lecture with an expressive instructor who displayed 'lively demeanor, warmth, and humor' while the content of his presentation consisted of non sequitur, jargon, and contradictions. Each audience - consisting of psychiatrists, psychologists, educators, graduate students - was fooled; they responded to Dr. Fox's lecture with overhwelmingly positive reviews.

So, cut the shit. Stop targeting the lowest common denominator. Keep the details. We care about the important nuances that you tinkered your way into that demand explanation, context, and our attention. Present something that we can ask questions of. Be yourself and we'll listen, I promise.

I came to see you, the scientist, the artist, but not you the magician or children's book illustrator (well, maybe the second).

There are exceptions. Elementary, middle, and some high school students likely benefit from this practice (for some period of time).

Sure, Pascal would have written a shorter letter had he the time, but maybe not a dandelion informing you to "Grow your network." And if the latter is the case, well then I'm glad Pascal kept busy.
