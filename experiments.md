#Experiments

I'm 33% more likely to commit to what it is that I set out to commit to when I write it down, or so says Robert Cialdini's [_Psychology of Influence_](http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Business-Essentials/dp/006124189X). 

But, I'm not actually writing my goals down, am I? I'm typing them.  

That will suffice for now, as action is better than inaction and I don't have a pen handy.  

This section is both to document experiments and to increase the likelihood that they're completed according to plan.  

##Project #0: Read 4 Blogs of Choice Every Day for 30 Days  

###Purpose
Learn something.  
Have answers to the following questions:  
1. Is there value in following 4 specific bloggers?  
2. Does this give me any insight into what subscriptions I can remove from my overwhelming list of RSS subscriptions (that I don't even look at)?  
Update: Yes. Sorry, Moby. No go.  
3. Is regular readership of a small number of select blogs superior to 'sprawl', or discovering content via social media channels, news aggregators, and newsletters? If so, in what ways?  
4. Do I feel I learn and/or retain more about a subject when I read about it daily for 30 days?  
5. Is this something I should do more of?  
6. Is reading a blog for 5-7 days each day a good way to evaluate the quality of a feed and my interest in the subject?  
7. Will this make me a better writer?  (how to measure the quality of one's writing is another experiment entirely)  

###Assumptions:
1. The authors produce thoughtful content  
2. The authors produce fresh content at least 3 times per week  

###Rules:
1. Read 1 posts from each of the 4 blogs per day (if there is no post for that day, read a previous, unread post)
2. No news/blog aggregation sites  (i.e. Mashable)  

###Start Date:  

###End Date:  

###Blogs I will read ever day for 30 days:  
1. [Occam's Razor by Avinash Kaushik](http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/)
2. [Moby's Journal](http://www.moby.com/journal)
3. [Google Analytics Blog](http://analytics.blogspot.com/)
4. [The Altucher Confidential](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/)

###Progress Log
Each day, I will check-in and bold the date after reading the latest post from all four blogs.  

First 10 days: **12** **13** **14** **15** **16** **17** **18** **19** **20** **21**  
Next 10 days: **22** **23** **24** **25** **26** **27** **28** **29** **30** **31**  
Last 10 days: **1** **2** **3** **4** **5** **6** **7** **8** **9** **10**  

####Notes  
Day 2:  
-Created Applescript to open the four blogs.  
-Binded Applescript with hotkey 'CMD + Shift + B'  
![Open Four Blogs Script](/assets/images/script-open-blogs.png)
-Learned that Kaushik reduced his posts from 3x per week to 2x, to 1x per week, which resulted in higher quality posts and substantial increases in traffic. Go figure. As a result, I'll work through the 'Knowledge' articles I haven't already read each day, and use Evernote to remind me where I left off (no need for that cognitive overheard, right? guys?)  

###Results:  
After 3 days, I knew whether I wanted to continue reading the author's blog. This made reading Moby's blog a chore (sorry, Moby), Altucher's exciting, and Avinash's exciting (though time-consuming - reasoning to come), and Google's somewhere in between exciting and a chore - maybe a necessary evil.  


This made me realize that I bookmark blogs or add them to my RSS feed too quickly and on the basis of one interesting post (which is usually the one I'm most likely to discovered as it's probably the one being shared across X, Y, and Z social media platforms).  

What Altucher and Avinash did extremely well was stay on track and incorporate information from past posts into their latest content. They're masters at luring you into a well-structured content library wherein current information relies on your understanding of past information, or lateral information, and so on. This is both blessing and curse for curious people. Both blogs typically frame the prior information in a positive way (i.e. recall from PREVIOUS, that you know how to do X; as opposted to, don't bother reading THIS until you've read PREVIOUS), but they still invoked that burning itch of "the more I know, the less I know." And I can't help but scratch. 

In response to the questions I hoped to answer:
1. Is there value in following 4 specific bloggers?  
Yes. In reading Kaushik consistently, I'm confident I would have a better working vocabulary and understanding of analytics. In reading the Google Analytics blog consistently, I surely wouldn't miss any important product updates. In reading Altucher consistently, I'd smile more, takes things less seriously than I do now (who couldn't?), and feel a whole lot less weird. That guy just makes you feel less weird. In reading Moby consistently - well - I wouldn't.  
2. Does this give me any insight into what subscriptions I can remove from my overwhelming list of RSS subscriptions (that I don't even look at)?  
Yes. Moby is gone. If ever I'm bored enough, I could likely open 3 or 4 tabs of blog posts from a given author and use that as a litmus test for my interest in following their blog. 
3. Is regular readership of a small number of select blogs superior to 'sprawl', or discovering content via social media channels, news aggregators, and newsletters? If so, in what ways?  
I shouldn't have written this question as really this was just one side of the test. Further, I think it's hard to make this comparison. The best I can do is that reading a small set of bloggers consistently will provide more depth than discovering content from wide range of sources (unless that range is all across one topic). 
4. Do I feel I learn and/or retain more about a subject when I read about it daily for 30 days?  
Actually, yes. Given Altucher and Kaushik's regular cross-linking and referencing of previous and parallel information, there is repetition - and that repetition aids retention.  
5. Is this something I should do more of?  
This experiment? No.  
More rigorous evaluation of and standards for what content I add to a library or follow? Yes. 
6. Is reading a blog for 5-7 days each day a good way to evaluate the quality of a feed and my interest in the subject?  
Yes. Possibly overkill.  
7. Will this make me a better writer? (how to measure the quality of one's writing is another experiment entirely)  
Yes, especially for the web. You begin to learn how authors bait you to come back to their site, to dig deeper, or to engage with (comment, share, or express my sentiment on a social platform) their content. You begin to see the importance of ledes, headlines, quotes from others, diagrams, and figures - depending on the type of content. Altucher's lure is his vulnerability and lack of censorship. It's like he writes down the most embarassing things he could discuss, and then proceeds to discuss them. And Kaushik's lure is the scarcity of his level of expertise. The knowledge he has just doesn't seem available elsewhere.
