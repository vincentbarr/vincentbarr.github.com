I attended my first New York Tech Meetup last week and it rocked. I wrote more about it [here](http://blog.timesunion.com/albany/what-i-found-at-new-york-tech-meetup/).

Highlights:  

* [Unroll.Me](https://unroll.me) is awesome. It gives you quick, total control over your newsletter subscriptions. You decide what gets delivered and when. Clean inbox.  
* [Engagio](http://blog.engag.io) is a good tool for people that engage with online content a lot. It collects your posts, then displays all unique responses in one place so you don’t have to revisit each blog that you posted on to comment.  
* [Squarespace](http://www.squarespace.com) will be the reason my website will look half decent (as soon as v6 releases). Future tense, remember. Many ridiculous features coming – autosizing images, super interactive pages, universal templating, etc.
