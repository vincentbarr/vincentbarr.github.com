This is my first _What I'm Reading_ post, and I haven't quite decided the best way to categorize what I've been reading. Sorting by day seems arbitrary, and sorting by week seems necessary to avoid you, the reader, facing a list of hundreds of links and consequently paradox of choice, FOMO, and other such things.  

How do you think I should group the things I'm reading/watching/skimming going forward? 

A few ideas:
1. By attention
a. Content I've Skimmed  
b. Content I've Read  
c. Content I've Saved  

2. By topic
a. Design  
b. 'Growth Hacking'  
c. Biography  
d. Hacking 
e. Applications   
  
The problem with sorting by topics is in determining what topics to use and how to handle overlap. This makes me want to avoid sorting by topic.  

3. By date 
a. [Most recent item]  
b. ...  
c. [Least recent item]
