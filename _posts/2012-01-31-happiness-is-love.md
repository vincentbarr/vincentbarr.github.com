Two researchers, Angus Deaton and Daniel Kahneman, [prove why hapiness does not correlate with income above $75,000](http://businessjournal.gallup.com/content/150671/Happiness-Is-Love-and-75K.aspx): people adapt to material items quickly, and at the end of the day, it's only a material item. The article then explores what really makes people happy: friends, personal relationships.
