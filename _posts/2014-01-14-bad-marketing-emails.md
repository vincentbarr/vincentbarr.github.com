I've gotten in the habit of collecting great emails. Ramit Sethi's subject lines and copy, Godin's ledes and concision, 99u's curation and summaries - they're all worth studying.  

Along the way, I've decided to start saving some of the real junk that I come across, as well.  
With the great stuff, you can simply subscribe to the newsletter and relive your experience each time; with the true crap, however, timing is often a factor (as improvement is inevitable, right?).

1. Sincere insincerity (Fiverr)  

###1. Sincere insincerity (Fiverr)  
Fiverr is a marketplace where people can offer and purchase a range of small services for $5. Cool concept.  

But, their email evidences the problem with fast and cheap work: it sucks.  

I love how they joined my first name and last name into one string with all lower case letters. It's like they know how I wish I could spell my name.

And doesn't Jess E.'s real, handwritten signature make you feel really special? She really cares about us, guys. A lot.  

Free tip for Fiverr: If you really want push the envelope (ba dum ch), instead of using the <code>|FNAMELASTNAME|.lower|</code> tag, try using: <code>|FIRSTNAMELASTNAMEE|</code>. Or, just to keep it real, change the email address tag to |EMAILL|, or subtract two from your building number when providing your shipping address, or take a year off of your credit card's expiration date when entering billing information, or just turn your computer into a cute, electronic rubber ducky and bring it into the tub with you, squeeze it, give it a bill, make it quack, etc.     

Trust me,
