People love their PowerPoints. Some even write PowerPoints about PowerPoint, or PowerPoints to help you make more PowerPoints, better PowerPoints.

When I 'Google' "powerpoint presentation rules," I can choose from 4,200,000 results (limit this to URLs ending in PPT or PDF and it's ~404,000). The etiquette that has evolved from this labor:

>Good PPT presentations use a font no smaller than 1,000px, present no more than on idea per slide, and follow a    1:10 text-to-image ratio.

This presentation etiquette is like a magician adding four inches to his sleeves, dimming the lights, and refusing to let you inspect the deck of cards. It's a problem, and it's the work of Blaine, not Tufte. [\[1\]](#fn1)

For context, let's take a look at these rules in practice. Slideshare receives ~60M unique visitors per month. Here are its "Top Presentations of the Day" as featured front and center on its homepage. [\[2\]](#fn2)

>Compiled next are five main lessons relevant to issues common across the industries.

First, concision =! quality. Had Pascal the time would his letters have become sketches of dandelions with captions like 'Grow Your Network?' Who am I to say, but I hope not.

Second, and more important, as a slide is whiddled down to several words and a chart to a one-direction arrow, we, the audience, come to depend more on the speaker to relay information. Our sensisitivity to body language, tone, and - to a lesser extent - words is heightened. The speaker, in turn, comes to lean on humor and nonverbal cues and away from insights, evidence, and context. [\[2\]](#fn2)

Nonverbal behavior is deceiving. It's sleight of hand, and even with good intention it often has an adverse effect. When you add images and remove text, you're only adding only cups to the trick.

##Expressive presentation masks quality.

Let's say you deliver two presentations. One is an informative, life-changing finding on X complete with supporting evidence and the debunking of commonly accepted hypotheses. The second is a phony, nonsensical presentation. You deliver both with high energy, humor, and warmth. Now, we the audience actually have no idea which was better. That means we have no idea which presentation was better. Really. We can't tell.

This phenomenon is explained by the [Dr. Fox Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Fox_effect). It states that an audience would not be able to discern the quality of two presentations - one of high quality (high content coverage) and one of of low quality (low content coverage) - when the speaker delivers them with warmth, humor, and high energy. When both lectures are delivered in an unexpressive manner, however, the audience can suddenly discern quality, or identify the presentation that was informative.

In a second experiment, pools of professionals sat through a lecture with an expressive instructor who displayed 'lively demeanor, warmth, and humor' as he delivered a presentation full of non sequitur, jargon, and contradictions. His audiences, each consisting of psychiatrists, psychologists, educators and graduate students, were all fooled, completely. They gave Dr. Fox's lecture overwhelmingly positive feedback.

Are we consciously saying, 'yes, such presentations styles may very well deceive us but they're just so much more... entertaining!'? Entertainment shouldn't be a prerequisite for education, which is why I believe this PowerPoint etiquette signals a problem with the audience, not the presenter or slide deck. Maybe the problem isn't that the speaker isn't much good at keeping our attention, but that we're not much good at giving it.  

So, let's stop targeting the lowest common denominator. Keep the details and nuances that you found most fascinating and that require context and explanation. Present something that we can ask questions of; that doesn't replace substance with dramatic pauses, the [superman pose](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/05/st_cuddy/), or pictures of babies. 

Be yourself, and the people that are meant to hear you will listen. I think.
