excerpt: An interview with Russ Graney, founder of medical startup Aidin.

I’m against cross-posting and feel that, while [content may be like water](http://alistapart.com/article/for-a-future-friendly-web#section3), that doesn’t mean it’s cool to just go around splish-splashing it all over everything in sight. I’m also against disclaimers.
And yet...

On to the point and I’d like to share a recent interview I held with Founder and CEO of [Aidin](http://www.myaidin.com/), Russ Graney. Aidin is an ambitious app that will better connect patients with post-acute healthcare providers and make the lives of discharge planners easier. A really bright, passionate guy who has done some cool things well before starting a business, such as founding [Uncommon Schools](http://www.uncommonschools.org/) in Bed Stuy, Brooklyn, is the the category of person that inspires me.

> **VB: As a young entrepreneur, how would you compare your current work-life balance to what it was when you were working for someone else?**  
> RG: The difference is that I don’t feel like I’m working here right now. Every day I wake up and it feels like, well, what’s the most exciting thing I could be working on today? And it’s what I’m doing now, which is a phenomenal experience. So, you know, in the traditional sense of work-life balance, it’s disappeared because I’m pretty much working non-stop, but at the same time that work seems like the most exciting and energizing thing I could be doing.
