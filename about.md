You can reach me at vincentvbarr at gmail dot com.

I built this site on Jekyll. Expect regular content, improved usability and IA beginning in March 2014. 

##n.
a) Tinkerer, autodidact, reverse engineer-er-er with an appetite for interdisciplinarity (and pistachios, red ones).

b) Doesn’t buy into the whole division between “left-brain” and “right-brain” thinkers; idea-generators and idea-executors; and people from upstate New York and rhythm.

c) Early in life, grew up reading hurricane-proof paperweights disguised as software manuals; building computers and small networks, dual-booting Windows and Linux (for no real reason), making basic (visual basic, basic) apps, and gaining an appreciation for anyone working in 3D Studio Max or Rhino 3D (props).

d) Stockpiles midnight oil. Reads McSweeney’s for LOLz. Urbant art enthusiast and muralist on hiatus.

##Causes

Co-Organizer of [House of Genius](http://houseofgenius.org/), an intimate, bi-monthly event uniting two entrepreneurs with a small, diverse group of panelists to think through a business or design challenge.  No professional information is disclosed until the end of the evening.  

Advisor, former Co-Chair of the Mentor Leadership Council & Mentor-Coach at [New York Needs You](http://www.newyorkneedsyou.org), a non-profit that helps first-generation college students recognize and pursue their aspirations, closing a considerable opportunity gap.  

##Other

* INTJ
* Gallup’s StrengthsFinder 2.0: Competition, Restorative, Command, Focus, Achiever

_I included the Other section at the cost of appearing (or being) obnoxious in exchange for the value of meeting potentially interesting, like/unlike-minded people._
