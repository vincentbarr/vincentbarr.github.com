The Bermuda Triangle isn't all that different from a parking lot.

Consider this Wikipedia entry:

You're picturing black pavement, yellow paint, and no way-finders (unless we're talking amusement parks). You're imagining a large designated space for storing (rearranging, and camouflaging) cars. 

And so am I. But, Wikipedia happens to be describing the Bermuda Triangle.  

Lucky for me, I've managed to avoid parking lots since moving to New York City 6 years ago. But, I've found a designated storage space that is as disorienting at 1/100th the size of a parking lot.

Imagine a wall of identical cubbies stacked on top of one another. The cubbies are opaque and their locks are identical. For comparison, imagine a prankster putting a wood shed over every car in the parking lot. That's basically what this is.

The only way to identify your cubby from another is by a modest dog tag, which, based on its size and visibility, is merely a way to distinguish one cubby from the next should the entire gym burn to the ground. Why else?

Here's how you get around that:  

**1. Where is my locker?**
