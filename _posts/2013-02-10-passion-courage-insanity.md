[Dan Osman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Osman), a free soloist rock climber, is an outlier.  

His fearlessness is a spectacle.  


At 1:10, Dan leaps from the mountain side – completely losing contact with the rock – and catches his next hold by 8 fingers.

Regarded as living a “[bohemian lifestyle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemianism),” Dan spent the least of his time working and the most of it overcoming one of our primal fears: falling. Dan climbs mountains without a rope, without support, and thus without excess.  

After a life of taking risks without any safety net, Dan died at age 35 doing a “controlled free jump.” He passed the risk from his hands to the threads of a rope, and the rope was the first to break.
