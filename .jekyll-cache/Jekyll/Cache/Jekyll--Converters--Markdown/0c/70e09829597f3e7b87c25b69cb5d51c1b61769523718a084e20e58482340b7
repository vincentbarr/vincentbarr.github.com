<p>Yet, I rarely know enough of the subject to determine just how exquisite the person is, but I can estimate. I like to consider how far above mediocrity she is in her field and just how close the second most exceptional personâ€™s are to hers. Trajectory, age, and background (or lack thereof) are of interest, too.</p>

  <li>Tied 41-year old chess grandmaster Kasparov at age 14 (ouch)</li>
  <li>Looked awfully bored beating a competitor with a 1-minute to 9-minute handicap</li>
  <li>Played 10 competitors at once with his back to the board, and wins</li>
</ul>
