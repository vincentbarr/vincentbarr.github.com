As a 10-year old, I had a closet fantasy. 

I imagined and reimagined discovering a small crawlspace in my bedroom closet that lead to an underground tunnel and exited to a safe, secluded place deep in the woods. You know, in case the bad guys ever came, or in case I ever wanted to venture off.  

Having seen the [Hidden rooms](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1ywk1y/have_you_ever_found_a_secret_passage_way_or/) thread on Reddit, I know I'm not alone. In fact, I hope that hidden rooms make the top 100 list of our collective consciousness.

Following close behind: tree houses.  

While I never came to find that hidden tunnel, I did have a sense for exactly where that tunnel would exit in the woods. And that was basically the next best thing. 

And so I would write and sketch plans for the tree house that I was going to build and then yelled to my mom that I may not be back for a long time as the screen door shut behind me and I was on my way.

I would pack a backpack full of 'supplies' - some sort of blueprint for a minimalist's tree fort; a peanut butter and jelly sandwich; rope and twine; colored pencils; a hammer and nails; and a pocket knife. Any excuse to use a pocketknife was a good one, as a kid.

To this day, I've never had a single time where I needed and used a pocket knife, mind you.

Typically, I would be back before dinner. The woods aren't much fun in the dark, as a kid, by yourself - and it turns out that climbing on trees can be a lot more fun than building on them.

When I discovered [Airbnb's Tree House Wishlist](https://www.airbnb.com/wishlists/stay-in-a-treehouse), I thought, 'Wow! My 10-year old self would have loved this.'

And now I ask for your help. 

Imagine that you're a 10 year-old boy who will be visiting your uncle in New York City for the weekend. You've only been once before and during your visit you toured Central Park and learned how to build boats out of bark (thanks to your awesome uncle). 

###What is the most awesome/memorable thing you could do? 

Please answer in the comments and I'll add them to the post.
