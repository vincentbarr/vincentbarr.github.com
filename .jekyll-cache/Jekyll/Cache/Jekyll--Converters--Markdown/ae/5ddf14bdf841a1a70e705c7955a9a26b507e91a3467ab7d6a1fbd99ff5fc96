I"M<p>An <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1802732/generation-flux-meet-pioneers-new-and-chaotic-frontier-business">exhilirating article for the expert generalist</a>, and a snippet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“DJ Patil is a GenFluxer. He has worked in academia, in government, in big public companies, and in startups; he is a technologist and a businessman; a teacher and a diplomat. He is none of those things and all of them, and who knows what he will be or do next? Certainly not him. ‘That doesn’t bother me,’ he says. ‘I’ll find something.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hats off to Robert Safian for capturing the hard-to-capture so well, so neatly.
What resonated especially was DJ Patil’s story. His low engagement in secondary education juxtaposed with his impressive, non-linear career trail. He graduated high school via plea deal and selected a junior college because his girlfriend was going there. Now, he appears in a national publication as a recognized expert in chaos theory with a career trail spanning LinkedIn, eBay, and the Defense Department.</p>

<p>It’s sort of fascinating: what happens when an individual finds the right substrate for their passion, interests, personality, or all three. It’s like they can whip what to most would appear a flat-line trajectory and turn it up to the sky like the telescope of one sun-hungry pirate.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28GLa9T2CtI">like it a lot</a>, and I think Facebook and other technology start-ups are partly responsible for giving the deserved and talented a “chance.” Such candidates probably would not get the time of day with a traditional HR recruiter.</p>

<p>And I have a few questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How large is the F-student-turned-subject-whiz population?</li>
  <li>Do individuals within this group share a set of common traits?</li>
  <li>What really causes a person to under-perform, particularly in an area in which they will later make tremendous contributions? – lack of interest, poor sleep, seasons of Dexter?</li>
</ul>
