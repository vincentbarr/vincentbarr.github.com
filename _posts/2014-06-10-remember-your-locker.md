The Bermuda Triangle isn't all that different from a parking lot.

For example, is the Wikipedia passage below describing the Bermuda Triangle, or a parking lot?    
> Popular culture has attributed various disappearances to the paranormal or activity by extraterrestrial beings. Documented evidence indicates that a significant
> percentage of the incidents were spurious, inaccurately reported, or embellished by

Hard to say.  

Lucky for me, I've managed to avoid parking lots since moving to New York City six years ago. But, I've found a designated storage space that is as good at hiding things as the parking lot â€“ and as disorienting - at 1/100th the size.  

Not as cool as it sounds. 

Imagine rows of nearly identical cubbies stacked on top of one another. A wall of practically indistinguishable doors. 

Indistinguishable except for a single number, a modest dog tag, which, based on its size and visibility, might be used only to identify cubbies to loved ones should the entire gym burn to the ground. 

Why else?

When I go to a gym or rent ice skates, here's how I find my cubby:
