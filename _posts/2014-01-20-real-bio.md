I discovered [Fred Einaudi's art](http://fredeinaudi.com/) and, consequently, his bio on [Virtu](http://www.virtuartgallery.com/about), an art gallery out of TN.

Now, compare Fred's bio to the three bios I chose blindly:

![Michael Parkes's bio](/assets/images/bio-michael-parkes.png)

![Camille Rose Garcia's bio](/assets/images/bio-camilla-rose-garcia.png)

And Einaudi wasn't just being impudent or clever on Virtu, no.

This man understands simplicity, concision, and self-awareness. 

When you search for Fred Einaudi, you see pictures of his art and three of his web properties (two without meta information entirely, and one listing the dimensions and titles of his work).  I'm not suggesting this observation was his intention, but it's still an interesting coincidence (and a nice example of confirmation bias, yeah?).

I admire Fred putting the footprint of his work before himself. It reminds me from a note in Henry Miller's _Tropic of Cancer_ wherein he suggests that everyone should call him Joe, call each other Joes, for it takes out a bit of the rubbish, the ego, the bias and irrational noise that blocks the signal of the message. 

In a [talk on Richard Feynman](http://www.ted.com/talks/leonard_susskind_my_friend_richard_feynman.html), physicist and professor Leonard Susskind stated that the way to honor Richard Feinman is by, **"getting as much bologna out of our sandwiches as we can."**

I have a reasonable dislike for biographies and a strong dislike for situations that require a response to the question, 'tell us a little bit about yourself,' or any of its variations. Maybe that's what I like about Fred's biography; it feels like one should. There's no bologna in it. He lets his work stand on its own. 

Thanks for that, Fred.
