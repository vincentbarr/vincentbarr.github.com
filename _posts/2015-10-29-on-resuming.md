In writing this post, I mark the revival of vincentbarr.com as a location where I practice organizing a set of thoughts and feelings into a structure to be understand by some population of readers. 

If I am able to communicate with even a population of one, beginning with myself as (occasional) editor and reader, then I will consider my effort worthwhile. 

I think that would be really rewarding actually.

And so here I am, finding that perhaps the most challenging part of starting emerges when one fixates on finishing, and what is required to reach this elusive destination. Nothing, in fact, is required. I could end right heâ€“  

But I don't.

It is awfully tempting to indulge my desire to call this draft 0 in order to flesh out an anecdote or another element from which I can 'hang' this post.

Leaving the post right where it is, here, feels a bit like assembling, painting, and mounting a coat rack on a wall in my apartment only to not hang anything from it. Maybe a belt. It feels empty.

Rummaging my attic for coats, or another garment with a loop for hanging, is a tempting solution. But, I'm certain I don't have an attic, else my air conditioner would not be serving as a foot stool here on October 29th in New York City nor would I wonder whether the incremental time spent republishing the unit's Craigslist listing and reducing the price by $25 each time it expires is worthwhile.

I could always seek out and buy a coat for the sole purpose of giving my coat rack purpose. To do this would be to buy a coat I may never even wear, and that I may come to do battle with upon entering and exiting my apartment, and  eventually discard. This realization may lead me to never buy another garment in my life.

And so, with restraint, I arrive and end here.
