Back when Facebook wasn’t a household name, Sean Parker & Mark Zuckerberg sought out [artist David Choe](http://davidchoe.com/) to pretty the ol’ office up with spraypaint.

Choe opted for equity over pay at the time, stating:
>"I like to party, I like to gamble."

"How did you feel when you heard the news that you might be an estimated 200 million dollars?"

>"It's how did I feel about the rest of the world knowing that, which I hated, you know. I was at home, and I was in bed and I got a text message. It was a woman I hadn't spoken to in five years and she offered me oral sex every day for the rest of my life for 2 million dollars, just out of the blue."

The thing is, David, that most people would be thrilled by 200 million dollars. For you, it's causing you pain.

>"I cannot buy my privacy back."
