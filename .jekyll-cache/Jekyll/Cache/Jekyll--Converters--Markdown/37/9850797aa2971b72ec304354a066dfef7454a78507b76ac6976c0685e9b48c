I"%<p>This past summer (August 2013), I planned to find a new apartment. I wanted to find a roommate to get a value than I otherwise would renting a studio.</p>

<p>Since I didn’t know anyone looking to move any time soon, I headed to Craigslist.</p>

<p>Attempting to sign a lease with two strangers was an educational experience, and is a post for another day.</p>

<p>Less educational, but more entertaining was speaking with and meeting potential roommates from Craigslist.</p>

<p>Here are three listings that tickled me to ⌘⇧4.</p>
