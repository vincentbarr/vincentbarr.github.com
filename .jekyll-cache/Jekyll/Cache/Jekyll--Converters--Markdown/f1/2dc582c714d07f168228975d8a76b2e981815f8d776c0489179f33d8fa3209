  <p>The new Bebo will be very different from the old one. Will it work? Who knows. But one thing is for certain, it will be fun trying.<br />
&lt;/br&gt;
Michael Birch, Bebo Founder</p>

<p>Birch recently bought for $1M the company he previously founded and sold for $850M (i.e. he bought his former company for about .1% of the price for which he sold it).</p>

<p>In his video, he describes the essence of what his product became: a whiteboard for penis sketches. He doesnâ€™t take himself too seriously, and I find that refreshing.</p>
