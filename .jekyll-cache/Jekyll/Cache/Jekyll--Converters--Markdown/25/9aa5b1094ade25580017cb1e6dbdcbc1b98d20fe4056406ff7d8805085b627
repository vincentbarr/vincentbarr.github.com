I"·<blockquote>
  <p>To prompt is to assist or encourage (a hesitating speaker) to say something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To prompt is to invite to dinner a guest that normally would not have a seat at the table. Ironically, this guest, and others like them, are the ones that we would most like to have join us.</p>

<p>Imagine that I ask you the following question.</p>

<p>â€œHey, how is your day going?â€</p>

<p>Think about your answer.</p>

<p>How long did it take for you to respond? How many potential responses were within your likely range?</p>

<p>We often respond to this question <em>without</em> reflecting on how our day has been (â€˜Itâ€™s fine, thank youâ€™), or shortly after dismissing the highs or lows that immediately come to mind and opting for a more neutral answer (â€˜Not too bad, you?â€™).</p>

<p>You could argue that people asking this question donâ€™t actually care about how your day is going. Itâ€™s a social lubricant. Itâ€™s an insincere question with the good intention of making both people feel acknowledged, quickly.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s fair.</p>

<p>But, in that case, why ask a question at all? Why not say, â€˜Hi, have a good day,â€™ instead.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s continue this discourse by assuming that youâ€™d like to be the type of person who, more often than not, asks questions purposefully and intends to listen to answers. After much practice, you rarely ask, â€˜how is your day going?â€™ without meaning it, and you rarely ask the question at all as youâ€™ve found prompts more useful.</p>

<p>Now, imagine that, instead of asking you your how your day is going, I ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What was the worst part of your day?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What part of your day restored your faith in humanity?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What part of your day do you keep revisiting in your head?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatâ€™s one thought you had today that you think I would judge you for?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You might need a second to think about your answer.</p>

<p>You might need, or choose, to reflect on your day, and how itâ€™s actually going, or, in talking through your answers, come to a general conclusion (â€˜My day is going fineâ€™) with more context (â€˜But I keep replaying how I felt on Saturday when I tripped over my shoelaces, fell down three flights of stairs, and was then rescued by my neighbor whom I would elope with two hours laterâ€™).</p>

<p>â€˜How is your day goingâ€™ is a fair question, but itâ€™s not a useful prompt for it does not invite under-exposed emotions, experiences, feelings, thoughts, or moods to the conversation like the prompts above do â€“ and thatâ€™s what weâ€™re after.</p>

<p>I believe that, for better or worse, people often need permission. Permission to share, permission to do, permission to adjust the temperature in the room.</p>

<p>If I ask you how your day is, you may not feel that you have permission to investigate the highs and lows of your day. If, instead, I ask you how bad your day was, then you can tell me precisely how bad it was and why without feeling like youâ€™re burdening or oversharing. If I ask you how great your day was, then you can tell me how precisely how great your day is and why without feeling like youâ€™re bragging. In the process, you may also realize that your day <em>wasnâ€™t</em> so bad after all, but there were a few events that made it feel as such.</p>

<p>If we ask good questions, if we prompt people, then we will get better answers and have more intimate conversations more often.</p>

<p>Questions create space for answers, but they donâ€™t give permission.</p>

<p>Prompts grant permission.</p>
