{% include JB/setup %}

At the close of my 10-week User Acquisition Marketing course at General Assembly, I was tasked with designing a feasible user acquisition plan with logical hypotheses. I chose to use [Asana](http://www.asana.com) as the subject of my mock plan. [\[1\]](#fn1)

The plan includes:
*  A complete media plan infused with back-o-the-envelope calculations estimating CLV (customer lifetime value) and CAC (customer acquisition cost)
*  A few channels: paid search, display, social, content, and earned media
*  Rube Goldberg- and Occam's Razor-influenced creative
*  An image from one of my favorite books on the closing slide

I am not affiliated with Asana and the plan is purely an exercise.
