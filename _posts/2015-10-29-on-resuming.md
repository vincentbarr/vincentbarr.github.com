In writing this post, I mark the revival of vincentbarr.com as a location where I practice organizing a set of thoughts and feelings into a structure can be understand by some population of readers. 

If I am able to communicate even with a population of one, beginning with myself as the (occasional) editor and reader, then I will consider my effort worthwhile. I think that would feel pretty great actually. 

And here I am finding that perhaps the most challenging part of starting emerges when one fixates on finishing, and what is required for one to arrive there. Nothing, in fact. I could end right heâ€“  

It is awfully tempting to indulge my desire to call this draft 0 while I think of a relevant anecdote or another element by which I can 'anchor' this post and expand on it until I feel I have wrote something worth sharing. 

Leaving the post right where it is, here, feels a bit like assembling, painting, and mounting a coat rack in my apartment only to not hang anything from it. Maybe a belt. It feels empty.

Rummaging my attic for coats, or another garment with a loop for hanging, is an appealing option.  But, I'm certain I don't have an attic, else my air conditioner would not be serving as a foot stool here on October 29th in New York City nor would I wonder whether the time spent republishing its Craigslist listing and reducing the price by $25 each time it expires is worthwhile.

Of course, I could always seek out and buy a coat for the sole purpose of hanging it. It would likely be a coat I may never even wear, and that I may come to do battle with upon entering and exiting my apartment, and  eventually discard.

And so, with restraint, I arrive here until I slow to a stop.
