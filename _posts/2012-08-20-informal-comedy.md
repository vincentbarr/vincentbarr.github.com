Less formal than what you ask? Your mother, I say.

But, no. I’m not sure – staged comedy, puns, knock-knock” comedy? Behaviors performed on a stage? Behaviors and the delivery of behaviors that are more likely to occur on-camera than off-camera?

Sure, all of those things.

Seinfeld recently started a web series called [“Comedians Getting Cars in Coffee”](http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/) and it’s hilarious

Check out one of my favorite clips thus far wherein [Brian Regan addresses dressing like a tenth grader](http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/brian-regan-a-monkey-and-a-lava-lamp/), dates who can do anything, and the utility of “just [giving] it a jiggle”.
