The Bermuda Triangle isn't all that different from a parking lot.

For example, which of the two does the  Wikipedia passage below describe?

I'd leave it to a coin flip. 

Lucky for me, I've managed to avoid parking lots since moving to New York City 6 years ago. But, I've found a designated storage space that is as good at hiding things and as disorienting as the parking lot, at 1/100th the size.  

Not as cool as it sounds, however.  

Imagine rows of identical cubbies stacked on top of one another. A wall of identical cubbies. 

Not quite as cool as this.


For comparison, imagine parking your car in a lot where, once you turn your back, a pranster places wooden sheds over every car in the parking lot like a magician placing red cups over a ping pong ball. That's basically what this cubby system does: it hides shit. 

The way you distinguish your cubby from the many other cubbies is by a modest dog tag, which, based on its size and visibility, is merely a way to distinguish one cubby from the next should the entire gym burn to the ground. Why else?

Here's how I find my cubby:

**1. Where is my locker?**

**2. Could that be my locker?**
