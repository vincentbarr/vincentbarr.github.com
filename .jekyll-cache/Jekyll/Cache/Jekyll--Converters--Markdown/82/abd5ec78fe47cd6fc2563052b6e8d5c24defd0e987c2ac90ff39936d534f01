<p><strong>The best way I’ve seen someone fill in an empty front row before a presentation?</strong>
Offer free copies of your book. People were practically jumping over chairs - and mind you the book hasn’t even been published yet. Good one, <a href="https://twitter.com/mattangriffel">Mattan</a>.</p>

<p>Get everyone rowing in the right direction</p>

<p>OKRs - objectives &amp; key results
-the objective is the mission. It’s subjective, not a number. It’s why we are doing what we’re doing. Goals are public or not at all.
-KRs are the measurement for reaching the mission. All KRs should not be hit, they’re goal posts. Pick a confidence interval and stick with it; otherwise, you’re moving the goal posts.
-should be made and reviewed quarterly
-pipelines and roadmaps should be reviewed on a weekly basis</p>

<p>Objective goals (theses)
Pipeline of ideas (experiment designs)
Roadmap against those goals (build, capture data, go for precision not accuracy)
Analyze results (learn, conduct post-mortem)</p>

<p>ex KRs:
KR1 - D1 Retention @ 95%, CI @ 95%
KR2 - 50% of signups become DAU (daily active users), CI @ 95%
KR3 - 50K DAU</p>

<p>Zynga almost never A/B tests; they do multivariate and sample testing</p>

<p>If you don’t have a control, then you don’t have an experiment</p>

<p>Creativity and science is harmony</p>

<p>Really good product people, really good CEOs don’t have a profile. They could be tinkerers, hackers, artists, and maybe sometimes MBAs.</p>

<p>Growth hacking requires:
mix of right and left brain thinking and patterns of it
design-savvy, customer-centric and analytical
creativity
analysis
leadership ability
intellectually honest over defensive
authority to talk to every part of the product
process and product instinct
Being good at a lot of things: more than just mastering customer acquisition in the first 3 steps of the funnel.</p>

<p>Investors vary their interest across 3 areas: product (Twitter, no revenue, all product), team, market (TAM: total addressable market)</p>
