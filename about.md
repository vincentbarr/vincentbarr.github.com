<h1>About Vincent Barr</h1>
<img src="/images/calvin-hobbes-dino.png">



<h2>n.</h2>

<p>a) Tinkerer, autodidact, reverse engineer-er-er with an appetite for interdisciplinarity and pistachios.</p>

<p>b) Doesn’t buy into the whole division between “left-brain” and “right-brain” thinkers; idea-generators and idea-executors; and people from upstate New York and rhythm.</p>

<p>c) Grew up reading hurricane-proof paperweights disguised as software manuals. Learned to build computers and small networks, dual-boot Windows and Linux (for no real reason), make basic apps, and gain an appreciation for anyone working in 3D Studio Max early in life.</p>

<p>d) Stockpiles midnight oil. Reads McSweeney’s for LOLz. Urbant art enthusiast and muralist on hiatus.</p>

<h2>Work</h2>

<p>Thrilled to wear many hats and work with a smart, focused team as the Online Marketing Manager (and part junior product manager) for 10gen, the company behind MongoDB.</P>

<h2>Causes</h2>

<p>Honored to serve as Co-Chair of the Mentor Leadership Council and Mentor-Coach at New York Needs You, a non-profit organization with the mission of helping first-generation college students recognize and pursue their professional aspirations, thus closing the opportunity gap. (This is the most moving non-profit organization I have experienced to date. Hands down.)</p>
