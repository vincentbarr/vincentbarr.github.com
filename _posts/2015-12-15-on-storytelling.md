> Storytelling and listening are reciprocal; water takes the shape of the glass.

A few years ago, I attended a day-long storytelling workshop instructed by Jerome Deroy and Terence Mickey.

The workshop consisted of two instructors, Jerome Deroy and Terence Mickey, twelve students - age 27 to ~75 – a tape recorder, pencils, paper and required six hours of listening, feeling, writing, sharing, and – of course – storytelling. 

Struggling also deserves a place on that list.  

With its emphasis on distraction-free listening, the workshop made it easy to avoid the temptation to take the kind of notes that, upon later review, make me wonder if I missed my calling in stenography. Such pedantic note-taking would likely have been seen as an offense and certainly a distraction to the group, a distraction that – as we were shown – is within our control to fix, and thus we have the responsibility to request that it stop, if not for ourselves, then for others who are also probably distracted.

What follows are my notes that I jotted down after the session.

## High resolution listening
> I strain to hear the speaker clearly over the noise in the hallway. Might we close the door?

As a speaker tells their story, take inventory of my internal (e.g. I'm hungry) and external obstacles (e.g. the guy next to me is typing on a mechanical keyboard using his elbows) that require my attention - however briefly - and thus distract my listening. Listen to thoughts, judgments, and needs. 

_Am I thinking about the bills I will have to pay?_  
_I'm cold. Is it just me?_ 
_Does my head itch?_  
_Am I missing a loved one?_ 

Then, 'out' the obstacles under my immediate control. Share them with others. If the room is too cold, then it is an obstacle to my listening, and likely an obstacle to others' listening. 

Say something. Do something.

## A story well told
> > How do I engineer a story so that the reader feels the emotions that I felt, at that moment, without saying what I felt or how I felt it?  

While listening to the speaker, take note of the moments when the speaker or his story draws me in, when I _feel_ something. 

_What happened?  
Was it the content?  
Did I see it with my eyes or hear it with my ears?_

I observed a pattern of elements that tend to lure me in as a listener. 

**Pauses**  
Don't rush. Wait. Stop. Begin again.  

**Honesty**  
Tell the story as it were, not as you prefer it to be.  
Reveal emotions, particularly those we like to censor out. Share an unpopular opinion, an inappropriate feeling, an unrefined action. 

**Share flaws, bruises, and bumps**  
Admission of imperfection builds trust, resembles reality, and may help comfort and silence the listener's obstacles that arise as they compare their own story to yours.  

**Vulnerability**  
A speaker who is vulnerable in the moment, not just in the tale, quickly has my heart and my ear.  

**Tone and volume**  
Events, descriptions, and time help to convey the content of the speaker's story while tone and volume help reveal the emotion of the speaker (and may wake a dozing listener).  

**Specificity**  
The sounds, smells, noises, and nicknames described in your story serve as anchors to a listener recalling your tale.  Remember, five senses.

**Precarious context**  
Juxtapositions, uncertainty, risk, promises, losses, and poor odds attract the listener's attention and build their anticipation.  

# When telling a story  
> Remember, as I describe a word in a story, the listener is imagining it. 

**Write my story as if it were told through a camera lens (and microphone**  
Cameras cannot speak on behalf of a character's inner feelings, thoughts, needs, or wants. A video can describe only what is seen or heard. 

A camera can tell you that I was shivering in the rain, or that I held the sweater she left behind to my nose before falling asleep, or that she smiled by pulling her bottom lip down from her top.  

**Communicate feeling through events, not internal dialogue**  
Stick to What, How, Where, When, and Who. Then, What Happened Next. And repeat.  

This is harder than you might think. 

For exercise, try telling a story without using the words, 'I thought' or 'I felt.' Tell your story with actions, events, and observable behavior.

**Use a story arc and your space**   
A story consists of a few major events that form an arc: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and denouement. To help you to remember the flow of your story and utilize the physical space available to you, pair each point in your story with a unique location in the room. As you arrive at a new point in your story, begin walking toward the physical destination you paired it with.
