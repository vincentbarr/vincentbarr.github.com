#Quotes

I have a like-dislike relationship with quotes.  

I'm refreshed when I find someone who took what was once a nebulous, lingering thought or feeling for me and converted it into a figure with edges, color, features, and a name. Now, that feeling is a person distinct from the millions of others like him. 

And some quotes are just so damn clever.  

Some that I enjoy in some way:    

> "We all have times when we think more effectively, and times when we should not be thinking at all."  

-Daniel Cohen, Children's Writer  

> "Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast."  

-Brian Birdwell, Manhattan GMAT Instructor
