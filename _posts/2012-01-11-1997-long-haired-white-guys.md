[Theo de Raadt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_de_Raadt) on computer software and security, circa 1997 at a [Hackers on Planet Earth conference](http://blip.tv/2600magazine/beyond-hope-1997-cdc-and-world-domination-5799413).  


> Theo: When you don’t like your job, do you do a good job?  
> Audience: No.  
> Theo: It sucks, right? It’s garbage… Everything that we’re working on trying to improve, it’s stuff that we want to and really fix and make better... It’s all just a best effort.  

In 8th grade, my English class was tasked with picking an interesting person from history and writing a research paper on him or her. I chose [Kevin Mitnick](http://blip.tv/2600magazine/beyond-hope-1997-the-kevin-mitnick-story-5799940) [\[1\]](#fn1). I remember reading about Kevin Poulin, MOD, and random text files from BBSs. With these soures and Tsutomu Shimomura’s _Takedown_, among other sources, to explain his capture from the viewpoint of his capturer [\[2\]](#fn2). I believe that is when computer security, software development, and the concept of taking something apart with the intent of finding a new or improved way of putting it back together again really caught my interest.  

Since, Kevin Mitnick published Ghost in the Wires: My Adventures as the World’s Most Wanted Computer Hacker in 2011.  I’m excited to read it, and I'll post a brief review when I get to this one.

Footnotes  
<a id="fn1">[1]</a> Ms. Podgorski originally denid my request to write on Kevin Mitnick. After a series of tries, I ultimately had to pitch my case to the vice principal and state that it was _really_ on his capturer, Tsutomu Shimomura. They had a more difficult time arguing with that, and I was allowed to write the Mitnick-centric paper.  

<a id="fn2">[2]</a> _Takedown_ is largely perceived as factually incorrect, rumor-ridden, egotistical, and simply an opportunity for Shimomura to take center stage and demonize hackers.
