##n.
a) Tinkerer, autodidact, reverse engineer-er-er with an appetite for interdisciplinarity (and pistachios, red ones).

b) Doesn’t buy into the whole division between “left-brain” and “right-brain” thinkers; idea-generators and idea-executors; and people from upstate New York and rhythm.

c) Early in life, grew up reading hurricane-proof paperweights disguised as software manuals; building computers and small networks, dual-booting Windows and Linux (for no real reason), making basic (visual basic, basic) apps, and gaining an appreciation for anyone working in 3D Studio Max or Rhino 3D (props).

d) Stockpiles midnight oil. Reads McSweeney’s for LOLz. Urbant art enthusiast and muralist on hiatus.

##Work

Thrilled to wear many hats and work with a smart, focused team as the Online Marketing Manager (and part product manager) for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com), an open-source [NoSQL database](http://www.mongodb.com/learn/nosql).

##Causes

Current advisor, former Co-Chair of the Mentor Leadership Council & Mentor-Coach at [New York Needs You](www.newyorkneedsyou.org), a non-profit that helps first-generation college students recognize and pursue their professional aspirations, thus closing the opportunity gap.

##Profiles

* INTJ
* Gallup’s StrengthsFinder 2.0: Competition, Restorative, Command, Focus, Achiever

_I included the Profiles section at the cost of appearing (or being) obnoxious in exchange for the value of meeting potentially interesting, like/unlike-minded people._
