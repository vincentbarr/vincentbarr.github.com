PowerPoint is something of a sexy topic. People really seem to like making PowerPoints, too, almost as much at they like skimming numbered lists.

Many write PowerPoints about PowerPoint. When I query Google for "powerpoint presentation rules," I can choose from 4,200,000 results. Limit this to URLs ending in PPT or PDF and I've got 404,000.

This mass has boiled down to a handful of rules, several we're all familiar with:

>Good PPT presentations use a font no smaller than 1,000px, present no more than on idea per slide, and follow a    >1:10 text-to-image ratio.

Such presentation etiquette, though, is like a magician adding four inches to his sleeves, dimming the lights, and refusing to let you inspect the deck of cards. [\[1\]](#fn1)

Let's look at SlideShare's "Top Presentations of the Day" as featured front and center on its homepage, and then I will explain why this is the work of Blaine - not Tufte - and a real problem.

As a slide is whiddled down to several words and a chart to a one-direction arrow, we, the audience, come to depend more on the speaker, to relay information. Our sensisitivity to body language, tone, and - to a lesser extent - words is heightened. The speaker comes to lean on humor and nonverbal cues and away from insights, evidence, and context. [\[2\]](#fn2)

Nonverbal behavior is deceiving. It's sleight of hand, and even with good intention it often has an adverse effect. When you add images and remove text, you're only adding only cups to the trick.

##Expressive presentation masks quality.

Let's say you deliver two presentations. One is an informative, life-changing finding on X complete with supporting evidence and the debunking of commonly accepted hypotheses. The second is a phony, nonsensical presentation. You deliver both with high energy, humor, and warmth. Now, we the audience actually have no idea which was better. That means we have no idea which presentation was better. Really. We can't tell.

This phenomenon is explained by the [Dr. Fox Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Fox_effect). It states that an audience would not be able to discern the quality of two presentations - one of high quality (high content coverage) and one of of low quality (low content coverage) - when the speaker delivers them with warmth, humor, and high energy. When both lectures are delivered in an unexpressive manner, however, the audience can suddenly discern quality, or identify the presentation that was informative.

In a second experiment, pools of professionals sat through a lecture with an expressive instructor who displayed 'lively demeanor, warmth, and humor' as he delivered a presentation full of non sequitur, jargon, and contradictions. His audiences, each consisting of psychiatrists, psychologists, educators and graduate students, were all fooled, completely. They gave Dr. Fox's lecture overwhelmingly positive feedback.

So, I ask that we cut the shit. Stop targeting the lowest common denominator. Keep the details and nuances that you found most fascinating and that require context and explanation. Present something that we can ask questions of; that doesn't require dramatic pauses, the [superman pose](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/05/st_cuddy/), or sad baby faces to communicate an idea and capture our attention.

Be yourself, and the people that are meant to hear you will listen. I promise.

Sure, Pascal would have written a shorter letter had he the time, but maybe not a dandelion informing you to "Grow your network." And if the latter is the case, well then I'm glad Pascal kept busy.
