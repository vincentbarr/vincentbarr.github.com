Advisor, former Co-Chair of the Mentor Leadership Council & Mentor-Coach at [America Needs You](http://www.americaneedsyou.org), a non-profit that helps first-generation college students recognize and pursue their aspirations, closing a considerable opportunity gap.  

##Other

* INTJ


_I included the Other section at the cost of appearing (or being) obnoxious in exchange for the value of meeting potentially interesting, like/unlike-minded people._
