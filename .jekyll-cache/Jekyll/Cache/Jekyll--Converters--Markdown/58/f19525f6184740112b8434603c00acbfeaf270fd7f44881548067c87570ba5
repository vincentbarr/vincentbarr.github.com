<p>I discovered <a href="http://fredeinaudi.com/">Fred Einaudiâ€™s art</a> and bio on <a href="http://www.virtuartgallery.com/about">Virtu</a>, an art gallery out of Tennessee.<br />
<img src="/assets/images/bio-fred-einaudi.png" alt="Fred Einaudi's bio" /></p>

<p>Fred almost immediately gained my admiration.</p>

<p>Compare Fredâ€™s self-written biography to the following three that I selected blindly:<br />

<p><img src="/assets/images/bio-michael-parkes.png" alt="Michael Parkes's bio" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/bio-camilla-rose-garcia.png" alt="Camille Rose Garcia's bio" /></p>

<p>In case youâ€™re wondering, as I had, Fred wasnâ€™t just being cheeky for Virtu. No, this is how Fred rolls.</p>

<p>Here is the bio listed on his personal website, fredeinaudi.com:<br />

<p>I like to imagine Fred exercising this concision, self-awareness, and perspective throughout his life. A stonewall among those greasing the slopes with signaling and foofaraw.</p>

<p>When you query â€˜Fred Einaudiâ€™ on Google, pictures of his artwork and three of his web properties (two without meta information entirely; one listing the titles and dimensions of his pieces) are the top results. Iâ€™m not suggesting that Fred is a keen webmaster and this was his intention, but it is a nice coincidence (and a nice example of my confirmation bias in action, eh?).</p>

<p>I admire Fred putting the footprint of his work before himself. Content before presentation.</p>

<p>It reminds me of Henry Millerâ€™s <em>Tropic of Cancer</em> wherein he suggests that everyone should call him Joe, call each other Joe, for it takes out a bit of the rubbish, ego, and biases that are born as we trade the signal of the message with the noise of its messenger.</p>

<p>When physicist and professor Leonard Susskind was asked how Richard Feynman would like to be honored, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/leonard_susskind_my_friend_richard_feynman.html">Susskind replied</a>, <strong>â€œby getting as much bologna out of ours sandwiches as we can.â€</strong></p>

<p>That I stretched Susskindâ€™s statement and applied it to this post is proof that my sandwich is at least three-quarters bologna.</p>

<p>In a World Wide Web where bologna-ridden biographies and â€˜About Meâ€™ sections are plentiful, Fredâ€™s bio rests among the few; it feels like Fred goes light on the bologna.</p>

<p>Thanks for that, Fred.</p>
