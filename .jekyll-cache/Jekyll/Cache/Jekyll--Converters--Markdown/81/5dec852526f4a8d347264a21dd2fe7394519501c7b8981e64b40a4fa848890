I"`<p>In no particular order, a handful of things that I learned this week:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>“<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324705104578147333270637790.html">Premeditating evils</a>,” or visualizing the worst case scenario of an experiment in detail, is a good thing.</strong> Odds are that the cost of failure is much less than originally conceived. I think this is because prior to premeditation, it was really the element of the unknown that was so terrifying.</p>

  <li>
    <p><strong>If New York’s Financial District were a website, it would win an award for New York’s worst navigation and information architecture.</strong> Try finding a place on Pearl Street, I dare you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>There are two morning activities that put me in the mood for holiday season love without fail:</strong> listening to Adina Howard and that seasonal cinnamon aroma in Starbucks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Neil Patel’s Quick Sprout blog is <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/">one of the best online marketing resources</a>.</strong> I read almost every article, in full, that he publishes. <a href="http://www.conversionxl.com">ConversionXL</a> is also good for conversion rate optimization, a/b testing, and the like.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> + <a href="https://www.exobrain.co">Exobrain</a> + 90M + me =</strong> improved information naming, sorting, storage, and syncing across all of my devices.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
