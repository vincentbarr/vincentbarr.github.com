A fascinating exploration of the exceptional, curious, and modest mind and character of physicist Richard Feynman.

On the Nobel Prize:
“I don’t like honors… I don’t see that it makes any point that someone in the Swedish Academy decides that this work is noble enough to receive a prize. I’ve already got the prize; the prize is the pleasure of finding the thing out; the kick and the discovery; the observation that other people use it. Those are the real things; the honors are unreal.” (00:30:09)
