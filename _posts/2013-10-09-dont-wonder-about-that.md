excerpt: Wonder where you left your keys; don't wonder what a person is like.

{% include JB/setup %}

When you read a good book, you wonder about the author. When you read about someone doing the something that you're really interested in, really well, you wonder about that person. You probably have questions for them.  

You wonder what they're really like in person. That's usually where it all stops: with wondering. 

Some things are meant to be wondered about: why your girlfriend left you, why I used to wear [UFO pants](http://www.raveready.com/v/vspfiles/photos/UFO82925g-2.jpg), and what book that woman is reading that inspired her to wrap the cover in the funnies section from the newspaper.  

People aren't meant to be wondered about. Speak with the people you're interested in. We like to meet people that are interested in us, so do the other person a favor: introduce yourselves.  

That's something I'd like to do a better job of, as I'm now around quite a few people who fascinate me.  

Consider...

This is a neat mental model I found on a quora thread.[\[1\]](#fn1) It was drafted by a gent advising students who were waitlisted/denied to graduate school whether they should email admissions committee members for constructive feedback.

He's got a point.
