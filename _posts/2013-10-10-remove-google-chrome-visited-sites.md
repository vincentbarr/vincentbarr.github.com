The latest release of Google Chrome (30.0.1599.69.) snuck frequently visited sites back into your new tabs. I imagine this could be a semi-traumatic experience for some.

Take the following steps to drop your most frequently visited sites from new tabs. 

1. Open Chrome

2. Enter 'Chrome://flags' in the address bar

3. Press &#8984;F and look for 'Enable Instant Extended'
