Remember that song? It goes, "...Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes." 

Me, too.  

And since 2003, I've taken and saved 2,773 photos.  

That's a lot of photos. 

It's not five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred photos, but it's a lot of photos. Too many photos for one viewer.  

That's why, today, I joined [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/vincentbarr/): to begin sharing my photo collection with others.  

Like me, you might wonder who would be interested in such a collection... 

Perhaps, a stranger in need of visual fodder for a PowerPoint presentation will stumble upon a photo, rotate it 90 degrees, and decide against using it. 

Or, perhaps, a spam bot — designed by a photography agency – that crawls and 'faves' my every upload.

My real hope is that some person out there will visit and revisit the collection from time to time. They could even call it _our_ collection if they liked. I imagine them signing-out of their Yahoo! Mail account and heading to my Flickr page to dig for a photo that will transport them to times past (can't be a moment in the future after all), to a moment they can't otherwise relive, not without DSC00421.JPG. 

But of course my hope does make a few assumptions:  
 
1\. That I disable downloads (did that).  
2\. That my visitors possess ethics that prevent them from taking screenshots of my collection in order to limit future visits to Yahoo!'s web properties.  
3\. That Flickr survives.  

The odds look good. 

In fact, I would say they are as a good as anyone reading this blog post from start-to-finish.

Oh, and there is one last assumption. 

4\. That I share that I have opened a Flickr account, decorated it with photographs that I have taken, and made it available to the public.

Readership, I have opened a [Flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/vincentbarr/), decorated it with photographs that I have taken, and made it available to the public. 

Find your DSC00421.JPG.

Sincerely,  
Vincent
