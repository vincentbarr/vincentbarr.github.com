excerpt: The weighted questions we use to judge our prospective other half.

{% include JB/setup %}

We all have our dualities, but Rollins's are either [more interesting](2012-05-26-why-do-anything-by-half), or more present.

Here, he explores an interesting little dating mechanism we all probably use in some form or another. It starts with the weighted questions we use to measure the other, the ones we fear the answer to so much that the tickle to ask is greater than any rational voice telling us that presence of a behavior or isn't grounds to dismiss a person, shreik, or end the date - and if it were, do we really want to ask that single question halfway into this 2-hour car ride? Probably not. 

But we do anyway.
