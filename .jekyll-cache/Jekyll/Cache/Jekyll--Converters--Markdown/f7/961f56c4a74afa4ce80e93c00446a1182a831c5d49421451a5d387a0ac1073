I"~<p>Remember that song? It goes, “…Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes.”</p>

<p>Me, too.</p>

<p>And since 2003, I’ve taken and saved 2,773 photos.</p>

<p>That’s a lot of photos.</p>

<p>It’s not five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred photos, but it’s a lot of photos. Too many photos for one viewer.</p>

<p>That’s why, today, I joined <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/vincentbarr/">Flickr</a>: to begin sharing my photo collection with others.</p>

<p>Like me, you might wonder who would be interested in such a collection…</p>

<p>Perhaps, a stranger in need of visual fodder for a PowerPoint presentation will stumble upon a photo, rotate it 90 degrees, and decide against using it.</p>

<p>Or, perhaps, a spam bot — designed by a photography agency – that crawls and ‘faves’ my every upload.</p>

<p>My real hope is that some person out there will visit and revisit the collection from time to time. They could even call it <em>our</em> collection if they liked. I imagine them signing-out of their Yahoo! Mail account and heading to my Flickr page to dig for a photo that will transport them to times past (can’t be a moment in the future after all), to a moment they can’t otherwise relive, not without DSC00421.JPG.</p>

<p>But of course my hope does make a few assumptions:</p>

<p>1. That I disable downloads (did that).<br />
2. That my visitors possess ethics that prevent them from taking screenshots of my collection in order to limit future visits to Yahoo!’s web properties.<br />
3. That Flickr survives.</p>

<p>The odds look good.</p>

<p>In fact, I would say they are as a good as anyone reading this blog post from start-to-finish.</p>

<p>Oh, and there is one last assumption.</p>

<p>4. That I share that I have opened a Flickr account, decorated it with photographs that I have taken, and made it available to the public.</p>

<p>Readership, I have opened a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/vincentbarr/">Flickr account</a>, decorated it with photographs that I have taken, and made it available to the public.</p>

<p>Find your DSC00421.JPG.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br />
Vincent</p>
