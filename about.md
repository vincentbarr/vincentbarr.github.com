Hi, I'm Vincent. 

I built this website on Jekyll, and my goal is to create a motley panoply of what has my attention – my thoughts, my experiences, my experiments, my work, and my hobbies – for readers to connect over, discuss, learn from, disagree with, or debunk.  

Progress toward goal (as of 08/24/2019): F (2 / 100)
