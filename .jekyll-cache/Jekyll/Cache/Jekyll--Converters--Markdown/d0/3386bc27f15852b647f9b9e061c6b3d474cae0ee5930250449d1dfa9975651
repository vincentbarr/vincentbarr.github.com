I"[<p>I attended my first New York Tech Meetup last week and it rocked. I wrote more about it <a href="http://blog.timesunion.com/albany/what-i-found-at-new-york-tech-meetup/">here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/nytm.jpg" alt="New York Tech Meetup" title="I take really good photos" />
Highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://unroll.me">Unroll.Me</a> is awesome. It gives you quick, total control over your newsletter subscriptions. You decide what gets delivered and when. Clean inbox.</li>
  <li><a href="http://blog.engag.io">Engagio</a> is a good tool for people that engage with online content a lot. It collects your posts, then displays all unique responses in one place so you don’t have to revisit each blog that you posted on to comment.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.squarespace.com">Squarespace</a> will be the reason my website will look half decent (as soon as v6 releases). Future tense, remember. Many ridiculous features coming – autosizing images, super interactive pages, universal templating, etc.</li>
</ul>
