  <p>Theo: When you donâ€™t like your job, do you do a good job?<br />
Audience: No.<br />
Theo: It sucks, right? Itâ€™s garbageâ€¦ Everything that weâ€™re working on trying to improve, itâ€™s stuff that we want to and really fix and make betterâ€¦ Itâ€™s all just a best effort.</p>

<p>In 8th grade, my English class was tasked with picking an interesting person from history and writing a research paper on him or her. I chose <a href="http://blip.tv/2600magazine/beyond-hope-1997-the-kevin-mitnick-story-5799940">Kevin Mitnick</a> <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>. I remember reading about Kevin Poulin, MOD, and random text files from BBSs. With these soures and Tsutomu Shimomuraâ€™s <em>Takedown</em>, among other sources, to explain his capture from the viewpoint of his capturer <a href="#fn2">[2]</a>. I believe that is when computer security, software development, and the concept of taking something apart with the intent of finding a new or improved way of putting it back together again really caught my interest.</p>

<p>Since, Kevin Mitnick published Ghost in the Wires: My Adventures as the Worldâ€™s Most Wanted Computer Hacker in 2011.  Iâ€™m excited to read it, and Iâ€™ll post a brief review when I get to this one.<br />

<p>Footnotes<br />
<a id="fn1">[1]</a> Ms. Podgorski originally denid my request to write on Kevin Mitnick. After a series of tries, I ultimately had to pitch my case to the vice principal and state that it was <em>really</em> on his capturer, Tsutomu Shimomura. They had a more difficult time arguing with that, and I was allowed to write the Mitnick-centric paper.</p>

<p><a id="fn2">[2]</a> <em>Takedown</em> is largely perceived as factually incorrect, rumor-ridden, egotistical, and simply an opportunity for Shimomura to take center stage and demonize hackers.</p>
