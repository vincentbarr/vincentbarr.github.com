I"å<p>Iâ€™ve been in the habit of collecting (hoarding) great emails. <a href="http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/">Ramit Sethi</a> consistently produces captivating, long-form subject matter day-after-day. Seth Godin does what I can only descibe as â€˜Seth Godinâ€™ day-after-day witout getting tiresome or seemingly witout recycling ideas.</p>

<p>Recently, Iâ€™ve begun collecting terrible marketing emails.</p>

<p><strong>1. Sincere insincerity (Fiverr)</strong>
Fiverr is a marketplace where people can offer and purchase a range of small services for $5. Cool concept.</p>

<p>But, their email evidences the problem with fast and cheap work: it sucks.</p>

<p>I love how they joined my first name and last name into one string with all lower case letters. Itâ€™s like they know how I wish I could spell my name.</p>

<p>And doesnâ€™t Jess E.â€™s real, handwritten signature make you feel really special? She really cares about us, guys. A lot.</p>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Free tip for Fiverr: If you really want push the envelope (ba dum ch), instead of using the <code>|FNAMELASTNAME|.lower|</code> tag, try using: <code>|FIRSTNAMELASTNAMEE|</code>. Or, just to keep it real, change the email address tag to</td>
      <td>EMAILL</td>
      <td>, or subtract two from your building number when providing your shipping address, or take a year off of your credit cardâ€™s expiration date when entering billing information, or just turn your computer into a cute, electronic rubber ducky and bring it into the tub with you, squeeze it, give it a bill, make it quack, etc.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Trust me,</p>
