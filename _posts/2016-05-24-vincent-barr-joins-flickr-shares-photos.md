Remember that song? It went, "five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes." 

Me, too.  

Since 2003, I've taken and saved 2,773 photos. 

That's a lot of photos. 

It's not five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred photos, but it's a lot of photos. It's an average of almost 213 new photos per year.

And that's 2,753 photos too many for one viewer. 

That's two thousand seven hundred seventy-seven photos too many for one viewer. 

That's why, today, I joined [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/vincentbarr/), to begin sharing this collection with others. 

Perhaps, a stranger who is in need of visual fodder for a PowerPoint presentation will stumble upon one of my photos, rotate it 90 degrees, and decide against using it. 

Or, perhaps, a spam bot employed by a photography agency will warm my heart by crawling my every post almost as soon as it goes live and 'faveing' it. 

My real hope is that a family member, friend, or acquaintance will visit and revisit the collection from time. They could call it our collection if they liked. After making a generous donation of $1,000 to a foreign prince who is down on his luck but with access to email and a Western Union, they sign out of Yahoo Mail and head to my Flickr page to search for that one photo that transports them to a previous moment in their life (can't be a moment in the future after all). It's a moment they can't otherwise relive, not without DSC00421.JPG. 

Of course, there are a few assumptions to be made: 
 
1\. That I disable downloads (did that).  
2\. That my family members, friends, and acquaintances possess ethics that prevent them from taking a screenshot.  
3\. That Flickr survive.  

The odds look good. 

In fact, they might be better than the odds of a family member, friend, or acquaintance – or heck, even a stranger – reading this blog post.

Oh, there is one more assumption. 

4\. That I share that I have opened a Flickr account, decorated it with photographs that I have taken, and made it available to the public.

Readership, I have opened a [Flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/vincentbarr/), decorated it with photographs that I have taken, and made it available to the public. 

Go on, now. Find your DSC00421.JPG.

Sincerely,  
Vincent
