Can you imagine how much time, energy, and order a universal course on digital asset management and email etiquette would return?  

I think it should be a requirement alongside Freshmen forum. Unnecessary CC’ing is unnecessary, yet there seems to be some grey tape around giving people candid feedback on their email practices.  

The praxis of Mark Hurst’s [_Bit Literacy_](http://bitliteracy.com/) and [Email Charter’s 10 Rules to Reverse the Email Spiral](http://emailcharter.org/) would go a long way. Hopefully, that undertaking isn’t too far away.

A few rules from Email Charter:  

>**2.  Short or slow is not rude**  
> Let’s mutually agree to cut each other some slack … We just want our lives back.  

>**3.  Celebrate Clarity**  
>Start with a subject line that clearly labels the topic, and maybe includes a status category [Info], [Action], [Time Sens], [Low Priority]. Use crisp, muddle-free sentences. If the email has to be longer than five sentences, make sure the first provides the basic reason for writing.  

>**5.  Slash Surplus cc’s**  
>CC’s are like mating bunnies. For every recipient you add, you are dramatically multiplying total response time. Not to be done lightly.
