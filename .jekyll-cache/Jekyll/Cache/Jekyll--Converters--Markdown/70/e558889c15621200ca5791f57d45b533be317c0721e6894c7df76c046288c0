I"±<p>The Bermuda Triangle isnâ€™t all that different from a parking lot.</p>

<p>For example, is the Wikipedia passage below describing the Bermuda Triangle, or a parking lot?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Popular culture has attributed various disappearances to the paranormal or activity by extraterrestrial beings. Documented evidence indicates that a significant percentage of the incidents were spurious, inaccurately reported, or embellished by later authors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hard to say.</p>

<p>Lucky for me, Iâ€™ve managed to avoid parking lots since moving to New York City six years ago. But, Iâ€™ve found a designated storage space that is as good at hiding things (i.e. my old car) from me as the parking lot â€“ and as disorienting - at 1/100th the size.</p>

<p>Not as cool as it sounds, though.</p>

<p>Imagine rows of nearly identical cubbies stacked one top of the other. A wall of indistinguishable doors.</p>

<p>Each door identical to the next except for a single number, a modest dog tag, which, based on its size and visibility, might be used only to identify cubbies to loved ones should the entire gym burn to the ground.</p>

<p>Why else?</p>

<p>When I go to a gym or rent ice skates, hereâ€™s how I find my cubby:</p>

<p><strong>1. Where is my locker?</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Could that be my locker?</strong></p>

<p><strong>3. My locker!</strong></p>
