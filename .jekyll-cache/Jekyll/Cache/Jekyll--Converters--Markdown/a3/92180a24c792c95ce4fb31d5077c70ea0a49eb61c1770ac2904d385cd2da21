I"Š<p>I canâ€™t help be but held captive and mesmerized by life experiences that depict the extreme triumph of will and examples of â€œlife hackingâ€ â€“ that is getting from Point A to Point B in an unconventional, yet effective, manner.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.universityherald.com/articles/2127/20120607/dawn-loggins-pursuit-happiness-homeless-student-earns.htm">Dawn Logginsâ€™s journey to Harvard University</a> is a good example, as is <a href="http://vincentbarr.com/essais/gac-filipaj-education/">Gac Filipajâ€˜s</a>, and many other heroes whose stories will go unsung.
The Tailored Scholar Blog describes Dawnâ€™s senior year:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€She also worked as a janitor, studied advanced-placement classes by candlelight in a hovel with no running water, and fiercely overcame the fact she was abandoned and left homeless by drug-addicted parents.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thatâ€™s some ferocity alright. Enormous congratulations to Dawn.</p>

<p>Hopefully, her story can serve as a tale of hope to motivate the many adolescents in similar, or worse, situations.</p>
