Hi, I'm Vincent. You can reach me at vincentvbarr at gmail dot com. On Twitter, I'm [@VincentBarr](https://twitter.com/vincentbarr?lang=en), and on LinkedIn, I'm still [Vincent Barr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentbarr/).  

I built this website on Jekyll, and haven't made significant, necessary updates in a long time.
