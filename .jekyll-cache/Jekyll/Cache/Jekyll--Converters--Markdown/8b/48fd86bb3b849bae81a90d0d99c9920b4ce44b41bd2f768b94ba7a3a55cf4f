I"å<p>Iâ€™m against cross-posting and feel that, while <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/for-a-future-friendly-web#section3">content may be like water</a>, that doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s cool to just go around splish-splashing it all over everything in sight. Iâ€™m also against disclaimers.
And yetâ€¦</p>

<p>On to the point and Iâ€™d like to share a recent interview I held with Founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.myaidin.com/">Aidin</a>, Russ Graney. Aidin is an ambitious app that will better connect patients with post-acute healthcare providers and make the lives of discharge planners easier. A really bright, passionate guy who has done some cool things well before starting a business, such as founding <a href="http://www.uncommonschools.org/">Uncommon Schools</a> in Bed Stuy, Brooklyn, is the the  of person that inspires me.
You can <a href="http://blog.timesunion.com/tech/1913/interview-with-russ-graney-founder-of-healthcare-startup-aidin/">read the interview</a> at my Times Union â€œTechâ€ blog.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>VB: As a young entrepreneur, how would you compare your current work-life balance to what it was when you were working for someone else?</strong><br />
RG: The difference is that I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m working here right now. Every day I wake up and it feels like, well, whatâ€™s the most exciting thing I could be working on today? And itâ€™s what Iâ€™m doing now, which is a phenomenal experience. So, you know, in the traditional sense of work-life balance, itâ€™s disappeared because Iâ€™m pretty much working non-stop, but at the same time that work seems like the most exciting and energizing thing I could be doing.</p>
