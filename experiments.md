#Experiments

I'm 33% more likely to commit to what it is that I set out to commit to when I write it down, or so says Robert Cialdini's [_Psychology of Influence_](http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Business-Essentials/dp/006124189X). 

But, I'm not actually writing my goals down, am I? I'm typing them.  

That will suffice for now, as action is better than inaction and I don't have a pen handy.  

This section is both to document experiments and to increase the likelihood that they're completed according to plan.  

##Project 1. Read 4 Blogs of Choice Every Day for 30 Days  

###Purpose
Learn something.  
Have answers to the following questions:  
1. Is there value in following 4 specific bloggers?  
2. Does this give me any insight into what subscriptions I can remove from my overwhelming list of RSS subscriptions (that I don't even look at)?  
Update: Yes. Sorry, Moby. No go.  
3. Is regular readership of a small number of select blogs superior to 'sprawl', or discovering content via social media channels, news aggregators, and newsletters? If so, in what ways?  
4. Do I feel I learn and/or retain more about a subject when I read about it daily for 30 days?  
5. Is this something I should do more of?  
6. Is reading a blog for 5-7 days each day a good way to evaluate the quality of a feed and my interest in the subject?  
7. Will this make me a better writer?  (how to measure the quality of one's writing is another experiment entirely)  

###Assumptions:
1. The authors produce thoughtful content  
2. The authors produce fresh content at least 3 times per week  

###Rules:
1. Read 1 posts from each of the 4 blogs per day (if there is no post for that day, read a previous, unread post)
2. No news/blog aggregation sites  (i.e. Mashable)  

###Start Date:  

###End Date:  

###Blogs I will read ever day for 30 days:  
1. [Occam's Razor by Avinash Kaushik](http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/)
2. [Moby's Journal](http://www.moby.com/journal)
3. [Google Analytics Blog](http://analytics.blogspot.com/)
4. [The Altucher Confidential](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/)

###Progress Log
Each day, I will check-in and bold the date after reading _all_ the latest post from all four blogs.  

First 10 days: **12** **13** **14** **15** **16** **17** **18** **19** **20** **21**  
Next 10 days: **22** **23** **24** **25** **26** **27** **28** **29** **30** **31**  
Last 10 days: **1** **2** **3** **4** **5** **6** **7** **8** **9** **10**  

####Notes  
Day 2:  
-Created Applescript to open the four blogs.  
-Binded Applescript with hotkey 'CMD + Shift + B'

-Learned that Kaushik reduced his posts from 3x per week to 2x, to once per week, which resulted in higher quality posts and substantial increases in traffic. Go figure. As a result, I'll work through the 'Knowledge' articles I haven't already read each day, and use this space as a place to remind me where I left off (no need for that cognitive overheard, right? guys?)
