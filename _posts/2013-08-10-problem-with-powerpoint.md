Good PPT presentations use a font no smaller than 1,000px. Great PPT presentations use 1:10 text to image ratio. Legendary PPT presentations present no more than one idea per slide.

Okay.

Now, let's look at this in practice vis a vis SlideShare's "Top Presentations of the Day" featured front and center on its homepage.

Who's responsible for this? Surely Blaine, not Tufte.

Sure, Pascal would have written a shorter letter had he more time, but I'm not sure that means he would have scribbled a dandelion and a caption, "Grow your network." We've made a lot of progress in the past few years and we now understand that $1M in costs and $10 revenue is bad; that crying baby and dropped icecream cone are imblazoned on my mind's eye (looking to get that removed  soon).

Here's the problem: expressive presentation masks quality.

As a slide is whiddled down to several words and a chart to a one-direction arrow, we, the audience, come to depend more on the speaker, to relay information. Our sensisitivity to body language, tone, and - to a lesser extent - words is heightened. The speaker comes to lean on humor and nonverbal cues and away from insights, evidence, and context.

What's so bad about that?

**Expressive presentation masks quality.**

Nonverbal behavior is deceiving. It's sleight of hand. And when you add images and remove text, you're only adding cups to your trick.

Let's say you deliver two presentations. One is an informative, life-changing finding on X complete with supporting evidence and the debunking of commonly accepted hypotheses. The second is a phony, nonsensical presentation. You deliver both with high energy, humor, and warmth. Now, we, the audience, have no idea which was better. Now, we the audience actually have no idea which was better. We can't tell. We don't know better.

This phenomenon is explained by the [Dr. Fox Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Fox_effect). Warm, high energy speakers make it near impossible for attendees to discern the quality (or content coverage) of two very different speeches: one high in content coverage, and one not. When both lectures are delivered in an unexpressive manner, however, the audience can suddenly discern quality, or content coverage.

In a second experiment, pools of professionals sat through a lecture with an expressive instructor who displayed 'lively demeanor, warmth, and humor' while the content of his presentation consisted of non sequitur, jargon, and contradictions. Each audience - consisting of psychiatrists, psychologists, educators, graduate students - was fooled; they responded to Dr. Fox's lecture with overhwelmingly positive reviews.

So, cut the shit. Stop targeting the lowest common denominator. Keep the details. We care about the important nuances that you tinkered your way into that demand explanation, context, and our attention. Present something that we can ask questions of. Be yourself and we'll listen, I promise.

I came to see you, the scientist, the artist, but not you the magician or children's book illustrator (well, maybe the second).
