As a 10-year old, I had always wanted to discover a small crawlspace in my parent's closet that would lead into an underground tunnel and exit into a safe, secluded place in the forest; you know, in case the bad guys ever came. Or in case I ever just wanted to venture off. 

[Hidden rooms](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1ywk1y/have_you_ever_found_a_secret_passage_way_or/) must top the list of items shared in our collective consciousness. 

Coming in at a close second would be tree houses.  

I remember writing elaborate plans for the tree house that I was going to build. I would inform my mom that I may not be back for a long time, and if she wasn't around then I would leave a brief note that I may not be back for a long time. I would pack a backpack full of 'supplies' - some sort of map that I had sketched, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, rope and string, a pencil, a screwdriver, a hammer, nails, a pocket knife (any excuse to use a pocketknife was a good one), and a book or something. I'd wear a hat for some sort of protection, even though I could only stand wearing a hat for a few minutes at a time before it irritated my head and I would have to take it off. 

Typically, I would be back before dinner. The woods aren't much fun in the dark, as a kid, by yourself - and turns out climbing on trees can easily get in the way of building on them. 

###When I discovered [Airbnb's Tree House Wishlist](https://www.airbnb.com/wishlists/stay-in-a-treehouse), I thought, 'Wow! My 10-year old self would have loved this.'

And now I ask for your help. 

Imagine that you're a 10 year-old boy who will be visiting your uncle in New York City for the weekend. You've only been once before and during your visit you toured Central Park and learned how to build boats out of bark (thank your awesome uncle). 

###What is the most awesome/memorable thing you could do (that your uncle could manage to arrange)? 

Please answer in the comments and I'll add them to the post.
