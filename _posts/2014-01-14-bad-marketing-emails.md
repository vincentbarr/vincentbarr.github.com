I've been in the habit of collecting (hoarding) great emails. [Ramit Sethi](http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/) consistently produces captivating, long-form subject matter day-after-day. Seth Godin does what I can only descibe as 'Seth Godin' day-after-day witout getting tiresome or seemingly witout recycling ideas.

Recently, I've begun collecting terrible marketing emails.  


**1. Sincere insincerity (Fiverr)**
Fiverr is a marketplace where people can offer and purchase a range of small services for $5. Cool concept.  

But, their email evidences the problem with fast and cheap work: it sucks.  

I love how they joined my first name and last name into one string with all lower case letters. It's like they know how I wish I could spell my name.

And doesn't Jess E.'s real, handwritten signature make you feel really special? She really cares about us, guys. A lot.  

Free tip for Fiverr: If you really want push the envelope (ba dum ch), instead of using the <code>|FNAMELASTNAME|.lower|</code> tag, try using: <code>|FIRSTNAMELASTNAMEE|</code>. Or, just to keep it real, change the email address tag to |EMAILL|, or subtract two from your building number when providing your shipping address, or take a year off of your credit card's expiration date when entering billing information, or just turn your computer into a cute, electronic rubber ducky and bring it into the tub with you, squeeze it, give it a bill, make it quack, etc.     

Trust me,
