There are some people who do things particularly well, unlike others; they're masters of their trade. I'm fascinated by them.

Yet, I rarely know enough of the subject to determine just how exquisite the person is, but I can estimate. I like to consider how far above mediocrity she is in her field and just how close the second most exceptional personâ€™s are to hers. Trajectory, age, and background (or lack thereof) are of interest, too.

Magnus Carlsen is in this group:

*  Tied 41-year old chess grandmaster Kasparov at age 14 (ouch)
*  Looked awfully bored beating a competitor with a 1-minute to 9-minute handicap
*  Played 10 competitors at once with his back to the board, and wins
