I"@<p>Many people find celebrity culture to be pretty interesting stuff. While that has never been my thing, I was interested to learn two things about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Depp">Johnny Depp</a>. The first being that he dropped out of high school to pursue his passion in music and start a band. Years later his acting career would emerge, and really out of serendipity.</p>

<p>The second is his modesty as told through a 1993 interview with Regis &amp; Kathie Lee.</p>

<p>Check out the juxtaposition between trained (perhaps obnoxious) extroverts and a humble Depp who isn’t interested in playing to the judge. It’s awesome:</p>
