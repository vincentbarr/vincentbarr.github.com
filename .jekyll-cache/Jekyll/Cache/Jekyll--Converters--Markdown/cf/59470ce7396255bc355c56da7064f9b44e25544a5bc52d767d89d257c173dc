I"ø	<p>â€œHow did you choose the Lower East Side?â€</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been asked this question by at least five people.</p>

<p>At least one of those five people asked out of sincerity and, I suspect, at least one preferred this question to a rhetorical one about the weather.</p>

<p>â€œFunny you should ask,â€ I reply.</p>

<p>â€œI decided to move here about two years ago, for three reasons.</p>

<p>First, when walking through the neighborhood, I discovered an opening reception for a few legendary NYC writers (graffiti artists) to the tune of a live DJ, a diverse crowd and a bit of grit. And I tend to like grit.</p>

<p>Second, Sunshine Cinema is within two blocks of my apartment. Sunshine Cinema shows only seven movies at a time. On weekends at midnight, they show one retro movie (Blade Runner was showing the weekend I moved in). Throughout the rest of the week, you can see a handful of of films that are independent, foreign, under-the-radar, or all three. Itâ€™s a very cozy theater (think ascending a flight of creaky wooden steps).</p>

<p>Third, the large trailers and storage units that line many of Manhattanâ€™s sidewalks receive special attention in the Lower East Side; they double as canvases for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/centrefugepublicartproject/timeline">Centre-fuge Public Art Project</a>. Once every two months, artists from around-the-world paint the bins. Walking back to my apartment on a Saturday afternoon, I have seen artists whom I admired in my early teens, such as The London Police, and others â€“ Andy Golub, Dasic, the list goes on â€“ painting live.â€</p>

<p>Those are the three main reasons I chose to move to the Lower East Side.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, the gallery of aerosol and music was shut down the same week that I moved into my new apartment.</p>

<p>As for Sunshine Cinema, it required a full year-and-a-half and a Tindr date before I would actually make my first visit. But, it was a memorable one.</p>

<p>Blow-Up (1966) was the the show of the hour and, if you havenâ€™t seen it or any of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo_Antonioni">Michelangelo Antonioniâ€™s work</a>, then Iâ€™ll leave you with an accurate description of what he is best known for: â€œmodernity and its discontentsâ€ and a â€œresistance to traditional storytelling in favor of enigmatic and intricate mood pieces, [rejecting] action in favor of contemplation.â€</p>
