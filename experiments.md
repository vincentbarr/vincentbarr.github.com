#Experiments

I'm more 33% likely to commit to what it is that I set out to commit to when I write it down, or so says Robert Cialdini's [_Psychology of Influence_](http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Business-Essentials/dp/006124189X). 

But, I'm not actually writing my goals down, am I? I'm typing them.  

That will suffice for now, as action is better than inaction and I don't have a pen handy.  

This section is both to document experiments and to increase the likelihood that they're completed according to plan.  

##Project 1. Read 4 Blogs of Choice Every Day for 30 Days  

###Purpose
Learn something.  
Have answers to the following questions:  
1. Is there value in following 3 specific bloggers?  
2. Does this give me any insight into what subscriptions I can remove from my overwhelming list of RSS subscriptions (that I don't even look at)?  
3. Is regular readership of a small number of select blogs superior to 'sprawl', or discovering content via social media channels, news aggregators, and newsletters? If so, in what ways?  
4. Do I feel I learn and/or retain more about a subject when I read about it daily for 30 days?  
5. Is this something I should do more of?  
6. Is reading a blog for 5-7 days each day a good way to evaluate the quality of a feed and my interest in the subject?  

###3Assumptions:
1. The authors produce thoughtful content  
2. The authors produce fresh content at least 3 times per week  

###Rules:
1. No news/blog aggregation sites  (i.e. Mashable)  

###Start Date:  

###End Date:  

###Blogs I will read ever day for 30 days:  
1. [Occam's Razor by Avinash Kaushik](http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/)
2. [Moby's Journal](http://www.moby.com/journal)
3. [Google Analytics Blog](http://analytics.blogspot.com/)
4. [The Altucher Confidential](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/)

###Progress Log
Each day, I will check-in and bold the date after reading _all_ the latest post from all four blogs. 

First 10 days: **12** 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21  
Next 10 days: 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31  
Last 10 days: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
