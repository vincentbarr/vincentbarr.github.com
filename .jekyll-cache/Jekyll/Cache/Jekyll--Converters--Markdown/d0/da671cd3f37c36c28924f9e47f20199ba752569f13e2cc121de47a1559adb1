I"ì<p>Design thinking means starting with the problem.</p>

<p>Facebook designer <a href="https://twitter.com/benbarry">Ben Barry</a> sees â€œdesign thinkingâ€ as one of the necessary, unspoken skills needed for great work, citing TextEdit as his weapon of choice in an <a href="http://the99percent.com/articles/7118/Facebooks-Ben-Barry-On-How-To-Hack-Your-Job">interview with the 99u</a>.</p>

  <p>â€œSitting down and getting thoughts in writing about what it is youâ€™re doing, who itâ€™s for, why youâ€™re doing it â€“ once you have that clear understanding, it becomes much easier.â€</p>

<p>Design-thinking requires you to understand just enough of a problem to begin asking the right questions. It creates a bias for action, gravity, one that will prevent your early assumptions from becoming the all-consuming - likely false - hypotheses that you will seek evidence to support, even when little exists. When you start with the problem, you tend not to stray far from it. I like that.</p>

<p>The hardest problems that I have had to solve have a common set of properties that arenâ€™t very surprising: grey, unclear parameters, and ambivalence - progress that might feel like â€˜betterâ€™ but could actually be â€˜worse.â€™ I like these sorts of challenges.</p>

<p>Asking the right questions questions of not just others, but also myself is something that I am trying to do more. <em>What am I about to do? Why am I about to do it?</em> If I canâ€™t figure out why I am doing something, then I try not to do it. I say try because there are those things that weâ€™re aware of doing, that we donâ€™t want to do, and yet we do them anyway. Theyâ€™re called habits.</p>
