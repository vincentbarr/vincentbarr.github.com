Design thinking means starting with the problem.  

Facebook designer [Ben Barry](https://twitter.com/benbarry) sees “design thinking” as one of the necessary, unspoken skills needed for great work, citing TextEdit as his weapon of choice in an [interview with the 99u](http://the99percent.com/articles/7118/Facebooks-Ben-Barry-On-How-To-Hack-Your-Job).   

>“Sitting down and getting thoughts in writing about what it is you’re doing, who it’s for, why you’re doing it – once you have that clear understanding, it becomes much easier.”  

Design-thinking requires you to understand just enough of a problem to begin asking the right questions. It creates a bias for action, gravity, one that will prevent your early assumptions from becoming the all-consuming - likely false - hypotheses that you will seek evidence to support, even when little exists. When you start with the problem, you tend not to stray far from it. I like that.  

The hardest problems that I have had to solve have a common set of properties that aren't very surprising: grey, unclear parameters, and ambivalence - progress that might feel like 'better' but could actually be 'worse.' I like these sorts of challenges.  

Asking the right questions questions of not just others, but also myself is something that I am trying to do more. _What am I about to do? Why am I about to do it?_ If I can’t figure out why I am doing something, then I try not to do it. I say try because there are those things that we're aware of doing, that we don't want to do, and yet we do them anyway. They're called habits.
