I"Z<p>Can you imagine how much time, energy, and order a universal course on digital asset management and email etiquette would return?</p>

<p>I think it should be a requirement alongside Freshmen forum. Unnecessary CC’ing is unnecessary, yet there seems to be some grey tape around giving people candid feedback on their email practices.</p>

<p>The praxis of Mark Hurst’s <a href="http://bitliteracy.com/"><em>Bit Literacy</em></a> and <a href="http://emailcharter.org/">Email Charter’s 10 Rules to Reverse the Email Spiral</a> would go a long way. Hopefully, that undertaking isn’t too far away.</p>

<p>A few rules from Email Charter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>2.  Short or slow is not rude</strong><br />
Let’s mutually agree to cut each other some slack … We just want our lives back.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>3.  Celebrate Clarity</strong><br />
Start with a subject line that clearly labels the topic, and maybe includes a status  [Info], [Action], [Time Sens], [Low Priority]. Use crisp, muddle-free sentences. If the email has to be longer than five sentences, make sure the first provides the basic reason for writing.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>5.  Slash Surplus cc’s</strong><br />
CC’s are like mating bunnies. For every recipient you add, you are dramatically multiplying total response time. Not to be done lightly.</p>
