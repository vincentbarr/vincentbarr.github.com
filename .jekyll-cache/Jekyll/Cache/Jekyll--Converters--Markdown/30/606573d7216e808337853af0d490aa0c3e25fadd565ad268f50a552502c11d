I"«<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Osman">Dan Osman</a>, a free soloist rock climber, is an outlier.</p>

<p>His fearlessness is a spectacle.</p>

<p>At 1:10, Dan leaps from the mountain side â€“ completely losing contact with the rock â€“ and catches his next hold by 8 fingers.</p>

<p>Regarded as living a â€œ<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemianism">bohemian lifestyle</a>,â€ Dan spent the least of his time working and the most of it overcoming one of our primal fears: falling. Dan climbs mountains without a rope, without support, and thus without excess.</p>

<p>After a life of taking risks without any safety net, Dan died at age 35 doing a â€œcontrolled free jump.â€ He passed the risk from his hands to the threads of a rope, and the rope was the first to break.</p>
