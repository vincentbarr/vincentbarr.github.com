Michael Birch, Bebo Founder

Birch recently bought for $1M the company he previously founded and sold for $850M (i.e. he bought his former company for about .1% of the price for which he sold it).  

In his video, he describes the essence of what his product became: a whiteboard for penis sketches. He doesn't take himself too seriously, and I find that refreshing.
